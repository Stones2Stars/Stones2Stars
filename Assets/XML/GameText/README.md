LIST OF CHANGES 02/05/2025:
SUMMARY: Big typo and sentence improvement update:
The changes in this version focus exclusively on systematically upgrading all in-game text. This includes correcting typos, applying proper punctuation, enhancing sentence style and clarity, removing redundant words, fixing awkward phrasing, consistent use of articles, subject-verb agreement, scrutinizing tenses, and maintaining a uniform stylistic tone, especially with regard to the capitalization of game concepts and mechanics. Hundreds of minor edits have been made. I plan on starting a game after this is done and I'll see if I can spot anything left to fix in plain text during this.

I have also applied Americanization to all plain text for the sake of consistency, as this was inconsistent even within individual pedia entries, this is in spite of me being British. Almost all the edits made involve simply improving the clarity of communication within the entry, rather than adding new information to each entry, though there are a few entries where I add new information, particularly in the pedia entries, if I think something important in the entry description was missing. 

Reworking sentences compromised the bulk of the work. This is my first contribution to a mod so if I did something wrong just let me know and I'll fix it, if you disagree with an edit, let me know and I'll remove it, I hope to make more contributions to your mod in the future if you like what you see. I did also check every pedia entry in-game to check everything displayed correctly. Below you will find a list of files I changed and a description line by line of my intentions.

LIST OF EDITS:

====ALT TIMELINES====

1. Apocalypse_CIV4GameText.xml: 

- Line 17: "In addition, virtually all food and water is irradiated" Full stop added to make the subsequent sentence easier to read. 
- Line 17: "With a large portion of the country's infrastructure in ruins" changed to "with much of the country's infrastructure in ruins" (sounds slightly more dramatic and concise this way)
- Line 17: "bottlecaps" changed to "bottle caps" 
- Line 17: "with bottle caps providing a more conventional form of currency" changed to "with bottle caps acting as a familiar currency in the wasteland" stylistic change.
- Line 85: "desparation" changed to "desperation" "propelled" changed to a more stylistic "driven"

2. AtomPunk_Building_CIV4GameText.xml:

- Line 12: "fall-out" changed to "fallout" ... "of Chernobyl"
- Line 41: "discovery" to "advent" | "energy becomes available in such a big amount" changed to "energy becomes available in abundance, rendering..."
- Line 69: "With advanced technology, the efficiency of reactors increased even more" to  "Advancements in technology further improved their efficiency."
- Line 97: "With advanced technology and longtime experience with nuclear reactors, it was possible to build a centralized, huge complex of thousands of reactors" changed to "With advanced technology and extensive experience managing nuclear reactors, it became possible to build massive centralized complexes of thousands of reactor units." Improved stylisation.
- Line 125: "Nuclear Reactors were only used in buildings to produce enough energy for a whole city for a long time. Now it is possible to make them small enough to be installed in Aircrafts, Cars and Tanks." to "Nuclear reactors were once confined to large facilities capable of powering entire cities. Today, advancements have made it possible to miniaturize them for use in aircraft, vehicles, and tanks." Improved stylisation
- Line 139: "Jonas' passing" changed to "Jonas's passing" "is home base and headquarters of the team" to "is the home base and headquarters of the team" 
- Line 139: "inventions'" removed "'". "large government contracts" is now "lucrative government contracts," 
- Line 139: Sentence was broken and hard to understand, the new sentence reads as: "Another private compound owned by Venture Industries was acquired after the original Team Venture thwarted a scheme by Scaramantula's Fraternity of Torment. Venture Industries also maintains a presence on Spider Skull Island, now being run (rather successfully) by Jonas Venture, Jr."

3. BioPunk_Building_CIV4GameText.xml:
- Line 26: Original: "Biopunk is a subgenre of speculative fiction, which emerged during the 1990s and focusing on the near-future unintended consequences of the biotechnology revolution, following the discovery of recombinant DNA. Biopunk fiction typically describes the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of ruthless human experimentation, against a backdrop of totalitarian governments or megacorporations which misuse biotechnologies as means of social control or profiteering." to "Biopunk is a subgenre of speculative fiction, which emerged during the 1990s, focusing on the near-future unintended consequences of the biotechnology revolution, following the discovery of recombinant DNA. Biopunk fiction typically describes the struggles of individuals or groups who are the results of ruthless human experimentation, struggling against totalitarian governments or megacorporations which misuse biotechnologies as a means of social control or profiteering."
- Line 41: Original: "Biopunk (a portmanteau synthesizing "biotechnology" and "punk") is a techno-progressive movement advocating open access to genetic information. Biopunk hobbyists or biohackers experiment with DNA and other aspects of genetics. The related biopunk science fiction genre focuses on biotechnology and subversives." to "Biopunk (a portmanteau of "biotechnology" and "punk") is a techno-progressive movement that advocates for open access to genetic information. Biopunk hobbyists or biohackers experiment with DNA and other aspects of genetics. The related biopunk science fiction genre explores themes of biotechnology and features subversive individuals who challenge the authorities and societal norms."
- Line 55: Original: "People come here to get some body parts of animals." changed to "A cutting-edge facility where clients undergo controversial procedures to integrate animal traits into their bodies. Whether for strength, speed, or survival, the Chimera Surgery Clinic transgresses and perhaps even violates the very notion of the human, for better or for worse." While a bit generic I am happy with this for now.
- Line 83: Original "Animal Designer from the whole World come to this event to show their creations." changed to "Animal Designers from around the world come to this event to showcase their creations."
- Line 97: Original "Animals are designed by gene manipulation and exposed in zoos." changed to "Genetically modified animals, created through gene manipulation, are showcased in zoos to the public."
- Line 111: Original "Microbiology Artists create new microorganisms whose only purpose is that they look beautiful under a microscope." changed to "Microbiology Artists engineer novel microorganisms designed solely for their aesthetic appeal under the microscope, these are living sculptures crafted at the cellular level."
- Line 125: Original "A pheromone is a" Changed to "Pheromones are" "chemical factor" changed to "chemical substances" 
- Line 153: Original "The idea is to turn your whole city into green: You life in designed trees, use designed Animals for transport, basically everything is grown naturally." changed to "The idea is to transform your entire city into a living ecosystem: you live in engineered trees, travel using bio designed animals, and rely on structures and systems that are grown rather than built. In this world, nature is not preserved; it is designed."
- Line 167: Added a sentence "Cloning technology has advanced such that it is now possible to bring back extinct species." to clarify that the species revival lab is about bringing back species from extinction, currently the text only mentions cloning.
- Line 181: Wanted to make this clearer and more stylistic | old version: "Weaponizing the plants allows users to grasp and strike continuously with vines and roots, project thorns at a distance, and quickly regenerate the withering weapons at the user's will. They can cause horticulture found, i.e. wrap of vines, to grow and climb around a target's neck, causing choking, or even strike with plants. A more subtle technique is to release damaging toxins and pheromones, affecting targets in which conditions should be treated quickly with ailments." NEW VERSION: "Weaponizing plants allows users to grasp and strike intruders with vines and roots, and to project thorns from a distance. Flora can be directed to grow around a targetâ€™s neck, causing choking, or used as blunt force weapons in direct combat. More subtle applications include the release of toxins and pheromones that poison or disorient targets unless they possess biological immunity."

4. BioPunk_CIV4GameText.xml:
// Comment: why is this separate to the main biopunk xml file? I may merge this with the main biopunk file in a future update. //

- Line 13: New sentence: "The Organic Infantry grows its own ammunition and weaponry using biopunk innovations, turning biology into a battlefield asset."

5. LaraCroft_CIV4GameText.xml:
- Line 26: Removed duplicate "had" redundant hyphen, replaced "secured" with "sheltered". Americanized English.

6. Clockpunk_CIV4GameText.xml:
- Line 106: "book music" to "book of music"
- Line 175: "A [COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Clockwork Golem[COLOR_REVERT] is a combat unit, with good all-around skills and generally man-like in shape. In most cases, melee weapons are built directly onto its arms and a cannon is mounted in its chest. Despite moving with a variety of whirrs, clicks, and other mechanical sounds, it's a perfectly functioning and potentially deadly machine." changed to "A [COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Clockwork Golem[COLOR_REVERT] is a combat unit, possessing balanced capabilities and a humanoid frame. In most cases, melee weapons are integrated directly into its arms, and a cannon is installed into its chest. Despite moving with a variety of whirrs, clicks, and other mechanical sounds, it remains a fully operational and potentially lethal machine."
- Line 221: designers were inspired changed to "Designers were inspired by,"
- Line 224: comma added

7. CyberPunk_CIV4GameText.xml:
- Line 12: Improved the wording of the Cyberpunk pedia entry. 
Revised version: 
"Cyberpunk is a postmodern science fiction genre noted for its focus on "high tech and low life." It features advanced science, especially in the fields of information technology and cybernetics, often accompanied by either a partial collapse or a radical change of the social order. Cyberpunk stories often dwell on the idea of technological innovations outpacing both the accepted social structures and government's ability to maintain an exclusive monopoly on control through legislation and violence. Cyberpunk plots often center on conflicts between hackers, cyborgs, androids, artificial intelligences, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in near-future Earth rather than the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as Isaac Asimov's Foundation, or Frank Herbert's Dune. The settings of these works are usually post-industrial dystopias, characterized by vast wealth inequality and a willingness to steal and repurpose corporate technologies ("the street finds its own uses for things"). Much of the genre's atmosphere echoes film noir (e.g., Blade Runner), and written works often use techniques from detective fiction. Cyberpunk is frequently preoccupied with exploring and redefining the boundaries of what a human being is."

Not Finished

12. Captives_CIV4GameText.xml
The wording was inconsistent across different units, despite describing the same process of upgrading from a captive unit, now the wording is consistent across all entries and clearer, the game concepts are capitalised here to convey the game mechanics more unambiguously. Overall relatively minor edits made here. 

13. Captives_Concept_CIV4GameText.xml

NOT FINISHED

16. Traits_TB_CIV4GameText.xml:
Comma's added, many hundreds of capitalization changes done through automated alt-a. For game concepts/mechanics e.g. Research, State Religion, Happiness, to standardize the stylization of the text and to minimize confusion for new players. E.g. Research should always be capitalized unless it is not referring to the game concept itself, but rather in a wholly generic sense. While I capitalize "production" as "Production" when referring to hammers, I do not when I talk about "Food production". I may have missed a concept somewhere, but I did my best to hit all the key terms. Before I did this, capitalization was applied inconsistently to game concepts within this file. 


17. UnsortedCiv_CIV4GameText.xml:
- Line 33   "but it you do" changed to, "but if you do" 
- Line 102 "Good days and pleasant nights, what do you think about this?." Removed Full stop after question mark.
- Line 207 Capitialised "neans" "weaks" changed to "weak" improved wording of sentence to the following "Good days and pleasant nights, the Neans dislike to taking advantage of the weak, but perhaps you prefer to stay in the good graces of the strong."
- Line 257 Changed the line "My Milita- people needs stuff, and everything in [CT_EMPIRE], can I have stuff?" to "My people require resources. Everything in [CT_EMPIRE] belongs to those with strength. Surrender what I ask â€” or it will be taken." I think that my change here reflects a more megalomaniacal and domineering mindset, this line is applied to Hitler. 
- Line 313 "when they are in need" changed to "in our time of need" this sounds better. "neans" to "Neans" 
- Line 321 Changed "What you will need to understand, [CT_NAME], is that anyone who fights on behalf of Allah, when he dies, the first drop of blood that comes out, all of his sins will be forgiven." to "What you must understand, [CT_NAME], is that anyone who dies fighting for Allah has all their sins forgiven with the first drop of blood." 
- Line 388 "Do not underestimate our resolve, [CT_NAME]. All strange and terrible events are welcome by the [OUR_EMPIRE], but comforts we despise." Changed to "Do not underestimate our resolve, [CT_NAME]. The [OUR_EMPIRE] welcomes adversity, we reject complacency and comfort." This sounds far more coherent in English, while conveying the intended meaning.
- Line 397 "Greetings, [CT_NAME]! I am [OUR_NAME] of the [OUR_CIV_ADJ] people. Help us safe our precious rainforest and you'll have our eternal gratitude!" Changed to "Greetings, [CT_NAME]! I am [OUR_NAME] of the [OUR_CIV_ADJ] people. Help us protect our rainforests and you'll have our eternal gratitude!"

Line 460: Americanized, hypens, punctuation, minor sentence adjustments.
Line 484: remove redundancies, tenses, americanized.
Line 508: The lush entry is very small, so I have expanded it, writing it in a pedia style. New information.
Line 535: Added more information to Marsh, this one was better than lush, but I felt it could be expanded, so I added new information.

Line 1017: offshore is one word.
Line 1047: typo fixing

- Line 12 Slightly improved the wording explaining world techs. Original version: A World Tech is a technology that can be researched by a limited number of nations in the game. Once that number have researched the tech no others can. Original code by Platyping.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Caveman2Cosmos the Religion techs are World Techs that only one nation can research. This is because those techs are both dead ends and one shot techs and this was the only way to ensure the AI nations did not waste research on those already discovered." New Version: "A World Tech is a technology that can be researched by a limited number of nations in the game. Once this set number of nations has researched the tech, no others can. Original code by Platyping.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Caveman2Cosmos the Religion techs are considered World Techs, as only one nation can research each of them. This is because those techs are both dead ends and one-shot techs and this was the only way to ensure the AI nations did not waste research on those already discovered."
