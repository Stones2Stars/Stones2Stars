# The mission / outcome system (`CvOutcome`) — reference + `missions`-migration map

> How the engine's unit **action → outcome** subsystem behaves, and how the **DATA** was migrated to JSON (#430).
>
> **⛔ Owner ruling — the outcome DATA is migrated to clean JSON; the CvOutcome ENGINE stays, fed from
> JSON.** The `CvOutcome`/`CvOutcomeMission`/`CvOutcomeList`/`CvOutcomeInfo` classes and their `execute()`/dispatch are
> **unchanged** — only the READ path flips from XML to JSON (`mapFrom`, like every other migrated info). The migration
> is DATA-side, exactly as [data migration is never deferred](../specs/validation.md#the-observation-surface) requires — the *mission
> concept* redesign is still a future ground-up rework, but the reward data is curated JSON NOW, not left in XML.
>
> **The shape (curator owns the conversion — old XML → correct new-system data):**
> - **OUTCOME_* info** (name / icon / requirements / odds / tier) → `Assets/Data/outcomes/*.json` (`curate_outcome.py`),
>   loaded via `CvOutcomeInfo::mapFrom` (`LoadGlobalClassInfoJson`). The WHOLE outcome surface — the OUTCOME_* infos
>   AND the per-carrier reward payloads — loads from JSON; the running game reads NO outcome XML.
> - **Per-carrier reward payloads** (the `<KillOutcomes>`/`<Actions>` blocks on a UNIT **and** a UNITCOMBAT — the
>   runtime merges both) → the unit/unitcombat `outcomes` JSON block (`curate_unit.py`/`curate_unitcombat.py`), the
>   **clean verb-per-payload schema** ([json.md §8](../specs/json.md)): `outcomes.kill[]` / `outcomes.actions[]`, each
>   `{ requires:{outcome:OUTCOME_*, plot?, unit?}, chance, <reward verbs> }`.
> - **`Adapt*` is pure engine, NOT data** — the gamespeed-scaling wrapper is unwrapped by the curator; the
>   engine scales the plain value at grant time. **Conditions → cascade `requires` vocabulary**, evaluated by the ONE
>   `cascadeEvalCondition` ([the DRY single-implementation law](../architecture/patterns/03-dry-one-implementation-per.md#dry--one-implementation-per-calculation--evaluation-the-single-source-law)) — **no
>   BoolExpr round-trip** (`m_pPlotCondition`/`m_pUnitCondition`/`toCity` are `CvCondition*`). Numerics build the
>   existing `IntExpr` (`int`→`Constant`, `{base,random}`→`Plus(Constant,Random)`). Python-authoritative gates
>   (`{python:fn}`) + inline `<Python>` bodies stay Python.
>
> The **hardcoded mission-abilities** (`MISSION_CONSTRUCT`/`DISCOVER`/`GOLDEN_AGE`…) are still the four `grants` keys
> (`buildings`/`greatPersonAction`/`goldenAge`/`greatPeople`) — a PERMANENT carve-out until the mission-concept rework
> unifies them with the data-driven outcome-missions. The "7 design questions" below are **SCRAPPED** (kept only as a
> record of the complexity that justified the DATA-only, engine-preserving migration).

## The three objects (the payload does NOT live where you'd expect)

- **`CvOutcomeInfo`** (`Infos/CvOutcomeInfo`) — a registered infotype (**100** types, `CIV4OutcomeInfos.xml`). It is
  **ONLY a gate + identity + replace-tier tag — NO effect payload.** Fields: `prereqTech`/`obsoleteTech`/`prereqCivic`,
  territory bools (coastal/friendly/neutral/hostile/barbarian), `city`/`notCity`, `bCapture`, prereq-buildings, a
  per-promotion extra-chance odds table, a `ReplaceOutcomes` self-FK list (tier supersession), a message string.
- **`CvOutcome`** (`Engine/CvOutcome`, read from each carrier's `<Outcome>` block) — **where the effect lives**:
  `unitType`, `promotionType`, `bonusType`, `yields[]`, `commerce[]`, `GPP`, `Properties`, `happinessTimer`,
  `populationBoost`, `reduceAnarchyLength`, `eventTrigger`, `bKill`, `iChance`. **`execute()` is DATA-DRIVEN** — it
  applies whatever fields the instance declares, unconditionally; it **never switches on the `OUTCOME_*` Type name**
  (those are semantic labels + the replace-tier handle only).
- **`CvOutcomeMission`** (`Engine/CvOutcomeMission`) — binds a `MISSION_*` to an outcome list. JSON-fed via `mapFrom`
  from an `outcomes.actions[]` entry: `mission`, `outcomeList`, `consumes` (`bKill`, **defaults TRUE**). The action's
  plot/unit conditions collapse onto the OUTCOME's `requires` (`CvOutcome`'s `CvCondition`), so the legacy
  `iCost` (`IntExpr` gold) + `plotCondition`/`unitCondition` (`BoolExpr`) members were REMOVED (no schema verb, no
  current data — the curator flags a stray action `iCost` as an unmapped tripwire). `propertyCost`/`payerType` are
  RETAINED inert; a `propertyCost` verb wires them when it lands.
- **`CvOutcomeList`** (`UI/CvOutcomeList`) — a `vector<CvOutcome*>` that **rolls exactly ONE** weighted outcome
  (chances summed, floored to 100 so a sub-100 sum reads as absolute %), after **recursively removing** any outcome
  listed in a surviving one's `ReplaceOutcomes` (higher tier prunes lower). `CvOutcomeListMerged` merges a unit's list
  with its combat-class lists, dedup'd by `OutcomeType`.

## Two carriers × two surfaces

Both `CvUnitInfo` **and** `CvUnitCombatInfo` expose both surfaces (runtime merges unit + all its combat-class lists):

- **`KillOutcomes`** (`m_KillOutcomeList`, `<KillOutcomes>`) — fired on a **combat kill** (the subdue/hunt case).
  Runtime: `CvUnit::updateCombat` (3100/3623). ⚠ **Subject asymmetry:** the **victor** receives the grant, gated by
  the **defeated** unit's kill-outcome definition.
- **`Actions`** (`m_aOutcomeMissions`, `<Actions>/<Action>`) — **player/AI-triggered** outcome missions. Dispatch is
  the **`default:` case** of `CvSelectionGroup::canStartMission`/`startMission` → `CvUnit::doOutcomeMission` (9279) →
  `getOutcomeMissionByMission` (unit info, then each combat-class) → `isPossible` → `execute` → `isKill()` ? `kill`.
  AI: `CvUnitAI::AI_outcomeMission` (15168) scores every action list over reachable city plots.

## Effect KINDS an outcome can produce (`CvOutcome::execute`, 991-1334)

Promotion · spawn-unit (at plot, or `bUnitToCity`→nearest/coastal city; subdued animals auto-join a hunter group) ·
city yields (production/food) · culture · GPP · **`CvProperties` deltas** (crime/disease/…) · temp-happiness timer ·
population boost · reduce anarchy/occupation timer · gold/research/espionage · **place a bonus on the plot** · fire an
**EventTrigger** · **embedded/compiled Python** callbacks · kill the acting unit. **All magnitudes are `IntExpr`
trees** (Constant/Random/Plus/Mult/AdaptUnitYield/Property/Python), conditions are `BoolExpr` trees — **not scalars**.

## The PARALLEL hardcoded mission-abilities (a separate, non-data-driven system)

18+ hand-coded `can*`/`do*` pairs in `CvUnit.cpp`, gated by dedicated `CvUnitInfo` flags, dispatched by explicit
`case MISSION_*` in `CvSelectionGroup` (the outcome-mission `default:` is the extensible alternative to adding more):

| key | `MISSION_*` | gate (`CvUnitInfo`) | produces | kills? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| found | FOUND | `isFound` | new city | yes |
| construct | CONSTRUCT | per-building `getHasBuilding` | building in city | yes |
| heritage | HERITAGE | `getHasHeritage` | player heritage | yes |
| join | JOIN | `getGreatPeoples` | +free specialist in city | yes |
| discover | DISCOVER | `getBaseDiscover`/`…Multiplier` | tech beakers | yes |
| hurry | HURRY | `getBaseHurry`/`…Multiplier` | +production | yes |
| trade | TRADE | `getBaseTrade`/`…Multiplier` | +gold | conditional |
| great work | GREAT_WORK | `getGreatWorkCulture` | +culture, clear occupation | yes |
| golden age | GOLDEN_AGE | `isGoldenAge` | golden age | yes (may consume several) |
| lead | LEAD | `getLeaderPromotion`/`…Experience` | promote a target unit | yes |
| infiltrate | INFILTRATE | `getEspionagePoints` | +esp points | conditional |
| espionage | ESPIONAGE | `isSpy`+`getEspionagePoints` | espionage mission | conditional |
| spread religion | SPREAD | `getReligionSpreads` | religion in city | yes |
| spread corp | SPREAD_CORPORATION | `getCorporationSpreads` | corp in city (gold cost) | yes |
| inquisition | INQUISITION | `isInquisitor` | purge non-state religion | yes |
| hurry food | HURRY_FOOD | `getBaseFoodChange` | +food | yes |
| claim territory | CLAIM_TERRITORY | (player fixed-borders) | set plot claim | no |
| great commander | GREAT_COMMANDER | `isGreatGeneral` | become Commander | no |
| great commodore | GREAT_COMMODORE | (option-gated) | become Commodore | no |

The three **carved-out grants keys** (PERMANENT carve-out — ground-up rework, out of #430) are members of this family: unit `buildings`→construct, `greatPersonAction`→
discover/hurry/trade/greatWork/hurryFood, `goldenAge`→golden age (and `greatPeople`→join).

## Data census

- **100** `OutcomeInfo` types (one file), effect-less gates. Semantic families: subdue-animal, hunting-kill, record-tale
  knowledge tiers, animal-combat arena tiers, unit-upgrade/conversion, join-city, slave system, cannibalism, human
  sacrifice, go-to-map/space-travel, colonize-map.
- **194** units with `KillOutcomes` (all wild animals). **237** `Actions` occurrences (subdued/tamed animals + 28 land
  units + combat-class-level). `<Action>` `iCost`/`bKill`/`PropertyCost` are unused in current data.
- **Curator: `curate_unit.py` + `curate_unitcombat.py` (shared `emit_outcomes`) + `curate_outcome.py`.** The
  `<KillOutcomes>`/`<Actions>` blocks convert to the clean verb-per-payload `outcomes` JSON (zero `{expr}`: `Adapt*`
  unwrapped, plot/unit `BoolExpr` → cascade `requires` vocab incl. `IS_OWNED`/`IS_ANARCHY`, `iHappinessTimer` →
  `happiness:{duration}`, inline `<Python>` dedented to compilable code). The `OUTCOME_*` infos convert via the new
  `curate_outcome.py` → `Assets/Data/outcomes/`. The engine reads it all through `mapFrom`.

## Why a full `CvOutcome` port is a PERMANENT carve-out — the seven things it would have to solve

> Per the owner ruling up top, that port is NOT happening: the outcomes stay in XML, and the future `missions` block
> just LISTS which missions a unit can use. This list is the standing JUSTIFICATION for that carve-out — read it
> before proposing a port, because each item is a distinct machine the `grants` shape does not have.

1. **Probabilistic, mutually-exclusive lists with tier-replacement** — roll one of N weighted, minus superseded.
   `grants` today is deterministic apply-all; missions need a "roll one, weighted, minus `ReplaceOutcomes`" semantic.
2. **Two homes for effect data** — the 100 shared `OutcomeInfo` gate/identity/replace-tier tags vs the per-carrier
   `<Outcome>` payload magnitudes. Keep the shared replace-tier registry separate, or flatten `OutcomeInfo` into a
   named gate/tier enum the mission entries reference.
3. **Expression-valued fields** — `iChance`, yields, commerce, cost, conditions are `IntExpr`/`BoolExpr` trees + a
   `CvProperties` delta; the schema must carry expressions, not ints.
4. **Non-grant-shaped payloads** — event-trigger firing, place-bonus-on-plot, reduce-anarchy, property deltas,
   spawn-to-nearest-city (coastal/teleport variants), embedded Python — these don't fit a pure resource-grant shape.
5. **Kill flag in two places** (per-`CvOutcome` and per-`CvOutcomeMission`, default TRUE) + the KillOutcomes **subject
   asymmetry** (victor gets the grant, gated by the defeated's def) must be modeled explicitly.
6. **Carriers include `CvUnitCombatInfo`**, and the runtime merges unit + all combat-class lists — the block can't
   assume a single per-unit list.
7. **Unify the hardcoded mission-abilities?** The 18+ hand-coded `can*`/`do*` missions are NOT data-driven today; the
   outcome-mission `default:` dispatch is the hook that could absorb them, but that's a larger reunification.
