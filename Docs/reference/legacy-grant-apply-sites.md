## 0. ⚖ THE SCOPE RULE (owner) — what the machine is for

> **The grants machinery's job is to UNIFY ALL THE RANDOM PLACES THAT ADD RANDOM THINGS TO THE MAP, OUTSIDE
> "NORMAL CREATION"** — construct / research / train / adopt / purchase.

That is the membership test, and it is deliberately broad: the qualifier is *how the thing arrived*, not which
info class declared it. If something appears in the world and the player did not build, research, train, adopt or
buy it, the machine owns it. Consequences that settle most of §5:

- **IN** — vote awards (including a whole city), NPC/barbarian spawners, combat loot / pillage / capture units,
  plot bonus discovery, leader-level-up traits, the trait city-founding provisions (`cityStartCulture`,
  `bonusPopulationinNewCities`), `barbarianInitialDefenders`, the start-era `freePopulation` / `FreeStartEra`
  buildings. **Being authored outside a `grants` block is not an exemption** — the scope test is how the thing
  arrived, not which block holds it; where a provision is homed elsewhere that is a HOMING question (§5.4), not
  a scope one.
  *(The scope test alone would also catch goody huts, random events, espionage payouts and outcome reward
  payloads — all four are OWNER-RULED OUT and belong to their own systems; see §2.)*
- **OUT — normal creation.** A built building, a trained unit, a researched tech, an adopted civic, an
  advanced-start *purchase*. (The advanced-start *budget* is granted; what it buys is normal creation.)
- **OUT — not an arrival.** A transfer or transformation of something already owned: `CvUnit::convert`
  (upgrade/merge promotion carry-over), unit merge/split, scrap refunds, production→gold overflow, negotiated
  deal/gift transfers, improvement upgrades.
- **OUT — modifiers.** Anything alive only while its source is (§4) never "arrived" independently; it is the
  source's ongoing effect, and it belongs to [modifier.md](../cascade.md).

> **⛔ THE MACHINE REPLACES LEGACY — IT NEVER WIDENS IT (owner ruling).** The goal is a FULL replacement and a
> **vast reduction of endpoints**: many scattered apply sites collapse into one. So a change that *widens a legacy

## 1. The classification that decides ownership

Three distinctions, each of which has already been got wrong at least once:

- **GRANT** — handed over once, then persists with no living source. The machine's business.
- **MODIFIER** — alive only while its source is; refcounted or toggled with the source's presence. NOT the
  machine's business ([modifier.md](../cascade.md) — the `freeSpecialists` precedent).
- **READ** — a consumer of the same info data for pedia/AI/UI. Not an apply, but **must keep working when an
  apply moves**, so it is mapped separately rather than discarded.

And, orthogonally:

- **LEGACY-THAT-STOPPED** — a legacy behaviour whose apply is dead today (usually a stubbed poco getter).
  Needs a ruling: was the drop intended?
- **NEW-DESIGN-NOT-YET-BUILT** — authored data for a mechanic that never had an apply, awaiting the machine.
  Not a regression. `grants.foundBuildings` (settlers seeding buildings at settle time) is this: a **new
  mechanic coined for this rework** (owner), not a port of the legacy `bNewCityFree`.

> **⚖ Reuse the engine's own partition — do not re-derive one.** `CvPlayer::applyEvent` takes
> `iEventTriggeredId == -1` to mean "replay the MODIFIER effects only" (`adjustModifiersOnly`,
> `CvPlayer.cpp:21270`, twin in `CvCity.cpp:17856`), and every one-shot handout in the event surface is already
> guarded by `!adjustModifiersOnly`. That flag is an existing, load-bearing, hand-audited grant-vs-modifier split
> over the whole event surface. Adopt it.

## 2. Apply sites by domain

### ⛔ OUT OF SCOPE — Python-driven subsystems (owner ruling)
**Goody huts, random events and espionage are Python-based and stay OUT of the machine**, in the same
compartment as the §5.1 Python-granting boundary. They have C++ apply helpers (listed below) — do NOT read those
as gaps to close: the C++ is the hand-over mechanism for a Python-driven system, and re-flagging them as
"unmigrated grants" is a rediscovery loop. They move only if the owner moves the Python boundary.

**⛔ OUTCOMES ARE NOT GRANTS (owner ruling)** — the `outcomes.kill[]`/`actions[]` reward payloads are their OWN
system, already set up separately: the `CvOutcome`/`CvOutcomeMission`/`CvOutcomeList` classes and their
`execute()`/dispatch are UNCHANGED, fed from JSON via `mapFrom`
([mission-outcome-system.md](mission-outcome-system.md)). `CvOutcome::execute` (`:1045+`) is that
system's apply, NOT an unmigrated grant site — do not fold it into this machine.

| granted | C++ helper (NOT a gap) | function |
|---|---|---|
| goody huts: gold, research, tech, XP, heal, reveal, free unit, barbarians | `Engine/CvPlayer.cpp:5915-6065` | `receiveGoody` |
| random events: gold, esp, research, golden age, bonus, religion, units, pop, culture, promotions | `CvPlayer.cpp:21261+`, `CvCity.cpp:17851+`, `CvUnit.cpp:21743`, `CvPlot.cpp:12542` | `applyEvent` |
| espionage: stolen gold/tech, bribed worker, culture | `Engine/CvPlayer.cpp:16000+` | `doEspionageMission` |

### Subsystems with NO inventory row at all (IN scope)
| votes: **an entire city**, pacts | `Engine/CvGame.cpp:8275`, `:8389` | `processVote` |
| NPC per-turn spawns | `Engine/CvGame.cpp:6653` | `doSpawns` |
| combat loot / pillage / capture / blockade gold | `CvUnit.cpp:2456`, `:7564`, `:1537`; `CvPlayer.cpp:2279` | various |
| leader trait granted on culture level-up | `Engine/CvPlayer.cpp:29249` | `doPromoteLeader` |
| plot bonus discovery | `Engine/CvPlot.cpp:812` | `doBonusDiscovery` |

### Python (genuine granting, in a layer scoped to stay Python)
`CvEventManager.py` — promotions on unit built (`:2010`), free units from popups (`:580`), settle-time culture
buildings (`:2443`, the only *live* settle-time seed), settler population (`:2459`), tech-triggered free units
(`:2229`, `:2257`), Nazca building bonuses (`:2301`) · `InitMilitaryPromos.py:131` · `RevEvents.py:740` ·
`BarbarianCiv.py:580`.

## 3. What this map surfaced — the live defects, and the questions it settled

1. **Building `grants.repeatable` — the APPLY belongs to the grants machine, not to the legacy members.**
   `CvBuildingInfo::mapFrom` still collapses each entry into the legacy members (which keep NO
   interval/enabled/chance), but those members serve only the AI/pedia READ consumers. The per-turn APPLY
   reads the composed `getGrants()->repeatables()` and honours
   `intervalPerTurn`, the `enabled` condition (through `cascadeEvalCondition`) and the property-scaled chance —
   gated on the operating-building set, so a dormant building grants nothing. The legacy sites
   (`CvCity::doPropertyUnitSpawn`, `CvCity::doHeal`, `changePropertySpawn`/`changeNumUnitFullHeal` and their
   `processBuilding` feeds) are DELETED. ⚠ Still open: **`m_aPropertySpawns`'s serialization survives as an inert
   stream drain.** Its shape is a count tag named `iNumElts` — **shared by 23 variable-length blocks in
   `CvCity::read`** — followed by N raw untagged records, so naming it in `savemigration.txt` would drain the
   wrong block, and dropping the write would orphan a tag old saves carry (leaving `iNumElts` holding the previous
   block's value and reading garbage). It retires when those blocks get per-block tags.
   `m_iNumUnitFullHeal` — a plain named scalar — WAS fully soft-removed (`Assets/savemigration.txt`).
2. **Three `changeFreeSpecialistCount` pushes are silently dropped.** The body no-ops unless `bUnattributed`
   (`CvCity.cpp:13163`, default `false` at `CvCity.h:1079`), and the cascade side sums only building/civic/trait
   deposits — so event grants (`CvCity.cpp:17979`), vote-source grants (`:14185`) and the espionage
   assassinate-specialist `-1` (`CvPlayer.cpp:16055`) all vanish.
3. **The game-start resolver reads `GC.getGame().getStartEra()`**, matching every legacy site. ⚠ Era-sourced
   game-start grants fire at NEW GAME only, so they cannot be exercised on the standing late-game save — the one
   place this map's claims cannot be checked without starting a fresh game.
4. **`SEVT_PLAYER_INIT` does not fire for every player who receives grants** — `initFreeUnits` early-returns on
   a null starting plot *before* the emit, and is only called for players with zero units and zero cities.
   Gold is also applied 21 lines *before* the emit (`CvGame.cpp:994` vs `:1015`).
5. **The religion founder grant — two things that LOOK like defects and are BY DESIGN (owner):**
   - Under `GAMEOPTION_RELIGION_DIVINE_PROPHETS`, `foundReligion` early-returns (`CvPlayer.cpp:8543`) because
     **founding a religion is an OUTCOME** under that option — the outcome system's job, and outcomes are a
     separate system from this machine (§2). Nothing is missing.
   - The `eSlotReligion` / `eReligion` split is deliberate, and the signature says so
     (`foundReligion(eReligion, eSlotReligion, bAward)`): the **SLOT** is what is being claimed (it drives
     `isReligionSlotTaken` / `getTechPrereq` / `setReligionSlotTaken`) and therefore sets the free-unit **COUNT**;
     the **CHOSEN** religion sets the free-unit **TYPE**. Slot = reward size, chosen religion = its flavour.
   ⚑ To MOVE this grant the emit must carry what the apply needs: the chosen religion, the slot religion, `bAward`,
   and the target city (`pBestCity`) — `emitReligionFounded` carries only player + religion today.
6. **Legacy-that-stopped:** `getFreeBuilding`/`getFreeAreaBuilding` → `-1` (404 authorings, chain + save fields
   intact); `isApplyFreePromotionOnMove` → `false`, making `CvCity::doPromotion` unreachable so a unit that walks
   into a city never gains the building's promotions.

## 3b. ⚖ THE PALACE: two triggers, not one (owner ruling)

The capital building is placed by **two different events**, and covering only one leaves an empire with no capital:

| event | who places it | status |
|---|---|---|
| a city is FOUNDED and the empire has no palace | the settler's `grants.foundBuildings`, gated `{BUILDING_PALACE, empire, max:0}` | ✅ live (the grants machine, off `SEVT_CITY_FOUNDED`) |
| a capital is CAPTURED and the capital relocates | **OWNER CHANGE must handle it** — not the founding gate | ⛔ nothing places it |

**The gate is "the empire has NO PALACE", never a city count.** A `{CITY, empire, max:0}` proxy is wrong twice: it
can never hold at founding (the grant applies after `initCity` has registered the new city, so the count is already
1 — verified live: the Palace was silently never seeded and games started with no capital), and it refuses the case
that matters — losing your capital while other cities stand should re-seed one. The building gating on its OWN
absence is correct at both triggers and needs no off-by-one reasoning.

**Why the civ-grant palace was NOT redundant.** `BUILDING_PALACE` used to sit in ~48 civilizations'
`grants.buildings` and was dropped as a duplicate of the settler's `foundBuildings`. It was not: `foundBuildings`
covers FOUNDING, while `CvPlayer::findNewCapital` / `setCapitalCity` place the **civilization building list** into
the newly-chosen capital — that list was the only thing that moved a palace on RELOCATION. Dropping it removed the
mechanism. (`findNewCapital`'s pick, for reference: `pop*4 + food + production*3 + commerce*2 + cultureLevel +
religionCount + corporationCount + greatPeople*2`, scaled by `(100 + culturePercent)/100`, excluding the old capital.)

## 4. Classification results (settled by reading the code)

**⚖ UNIT free promotions SPLIT THREE WAYS — only ONE leg is this machine's.** `CvUnit::setFreePromotion`
(`CvUnit.cpp:25942`) folds four sources with different LIFETIMES, so it must never be moved wholesale:

| leg | lifetime | owner |
|---|---|---|
| the unit info's own `getFreePromotions` — fed from **`grants.promotions`** (`CvUnitInfo.cpp:684`) | set at creation, never removed | **GRANT — this machine** |
| the player free-promotion registry, keyed by unit type AND by unitcombat (`CvPlayer::isFreePromotion`) | written **ONLY** by `CvPlayer::applyEvent` (`:21245`) | **OUT OF SCOPE — random events** (and genuine one-shot event-store state) |
| trait `isFreePromotionUnitCombats` | removed when the trait is lost (`setFreePromotion`'s `!bAdding` branch) | **TRIGGER/GRANT — this machine** (owner) |

Moving the whole function would import an out-of-scope event store into the grants machine — the exact §1
mistake. The unit-info and TRAIT legs migrate; the event-registry leg does not.

> **⚖ FREE PROMOTIONS LIVE ON THE TRIGGER/GRANT PLANE — EVERY LEG, INCLUDING THE TRAIT'S (owner).** The
> alive-with-source lifetime does NOT re-home this one to the modifier plane: a free promotion is a PAYLOAD handed
> to units, not a magnitude deposited into a channel, and there is no `freePromotions` modifier family for it to
> land in. It is the [json.md §5](../specs/json.md) `triggers` shape the BUILDING leg already uses — the units
> present promoted off `onUnitEnteredCity`, with the source going ACTIVE completing the same relation, one
> mechanism.
> ⛔ So the removing-the-source-removes-it test ([json.md §5](../specs/json.md)) does not decide the PLANE here;
> it decides `grants`-vs-`freeSpecialists` for a SPECIALIST, and reading it as a general plane test is what put
> this row on the modifier plane.
> ⚠ What stays banned is unchanged and is a different question: **do not restore a trait-side

**MODIFIER, not grant** — building `getFreeTraitTypes` ("conferred while active"); vote
`tradeRoutes`/`isFreeTrade`/`isNoNukes`/`forceCivic` (reversed on repeal); vote-source religion yields;
building/civic/trait `freeSpecialists`.

**⚖ THE FREE BUILDING IS A GRANT — "in all scenarios they behave like grants" (owner).** A building naming
another (or itself) hands that building over, and the receiving city genuinely HAS it: the authored data gates
on holding these targets in over a thousand `requires` atoms (`BUILDING_LIBRARY`, `BUILDING_OBSERVATORY`,
`BUILDING_COLOSSEUM` and their kin), so a shape that delivered only the EFFECTS would silently break every one
of them. It authors `grants.buildings` on the SOURCE ([json.md §5](../specs/json.md)), landing in every city of
the empire.
⚠ **This is a behaviour change from legacy, stated rather than hidden** ([validation.md](../specs/validation.md)):
the legacy pair was refcounted ±1 with the source's presence and REMOVED the copies when the source went. A
grant persists — losing the wonder keeps the granted buildings.
⚖ **The population SPLITS on empire-uniformity, and only the varying half stays a grant
([empire-level buildings](../specs/enabler.md#2-pass-1--generate-the-frontier-the-enables-family)).** A building granting
ITSELF into every city, and a `notConstructible` marker whose only arrival is an empire-wide grant, are
`identity.empireLevel` buildings the PLAYER holds once ([enabler.md §2](../specs/enabler.md)) — no fan, no
fold, nothing to transfer on capture. What remains on THIS model is the wonder granting an ordinary
constructible building to every city (a Granary, Irrigation Canals): real per-city copies whose presence
genuinely varies.
⛔ **For that surviving population THE APPLY HAS TWO LEGS, and the second is the one a fan-at-construction
misses: "AFTERWARDS" (owner).** A city FOUNDED or ACQUIRED later must receive the copies for every source its
owner already holds, so the grantor fact fanning over the cities that already stand is only half of it — the
other half fires when a CITY STARTS EXISTING and folds what the owner holds. This is the amenity fold's
two-leg shape exactly ([contexts.md](../cascade.md)), and it is what the legacy per-city
`checkFreeBuildings` sweep was doing. ⚠ A one-shot fan passes every test on the cities standing at the time
and silently misses every future one.
⚠ A separate ARRIVAL mechanism feeds the same targets and is not this: the buildings and heritages handed over
by animals or entertainers come from the unit's CONSTRUCT MISSION — its repertoire is the unit's own
`grants.buildings`, read by `CvUnit::canConstruct` — which places the first copy; the grant above is what
spreads it.

**GRANT, contradicting the earlier reclassification** — the **unattributed** free-specialist ledger
(`m_paiFreeSpecialistCountUnattributed`) is genuine one-shot state: Great-Person `join` consumes the unit so no
source survives (`CvUnit.cpp:8778`), city acquisition carries it (`CvPlayer.cpp:2606`), and **era-advance free
specialists are a persisted pulse, not a while-active modifier** (`CvPlayer.cpp:12187`) — which pins the lifetime
question [grants-machine.md](../specs/triggers.md) left open.

## 5. The rulings that govern the apply

1. **Python boundary (owner): Python events do NOT use grants yet.** The first pass of the machine
   is **DLL-scoped**, and the Python granting catalogued in §2 stays where it is — a KNOWN and accepted parallel.
   This is a deliberate boundary, not an oversight or a gap to close opportunistically. ⛔ Do NOT wire `CvEventManager` /
   Revolution / `BarbarianCiv` handouts into the machine, and do not claim "one place" without the DLL
   qualifier. "Yet" is deliberate: the boundary moves when the owner says so, and the map above is what that
   later pass will work from.
2. **Conquest re-grant.** `bFirst=false` on city acquisition is the engine's deliberate "don't re-fire grants on
   conquest" switch. The carrier is `SEVT_CITY_BUILDING_ADDED`, which carries `bFirst` (`emitBuildingAdded(..., bool
   bFirst)`) — the real flag from `CvCity::setHasBuilding`, hard `false` from the load reseed in `CvCity::read`
   (a load RESTORES, it is not an acquisition) — and the machine consumes it (`s_bFirstAcquire = (e.iA != 0)`,
   `CvTriggerEngine.cpp`), emitting it as `firstAcquire` beside `suppressed` so the withholding REASON is on the
   wire. ⚑ `bFirst` is deliberately NOT a second event: it does not say how the building arrived (nothing
   downstream may branch on granted-vs-constructed — [triggers.md](../specs/triggers.md)), only whether the
   first-build payload is owed. What the apply must then honour is the engine's own semantic; the ruling itself is
   not closed here.
3. **Serialized ledgers (owner): the machine REPLACES the existing per-turn work**, so the ledgers
   feeding it become DERIVED. All three are written only by `CvCity::processBuilding` (`changePropertySpawn`
   `:4255`, `changeHealUnitCombatTypeVolume` `:4352`, `changeNumUnitFullHeal` `:4370`, all
   `kBuilding.getX() * iChange`) — no event/vote/espionage writer exists — so each is a Σ over the city's buildings
   of a static info field: the STORED-ACCUMULATOR DRIFT class, cut by
   [the uniform legacy-accumulator cut](../cascade.md#-the-legacy-accumulator-cut--every-accumulator-one-uniform-mechanism) via the
   `Assets/savemigration.txt` soft-remove ([save.md §3](../specs/save.md)) — delete member + read + write, name
   the tag, no `WRAPPER_SKIP_ELEMENT`, **no `@SAVEBREAK`** (field removal is not a save break).

   ⚠ **But they are NOT one class — the replacement OWNER differs (§1: "several sites look like grants and are
   not"):**
   | ledger | mechanic | replaced by |
   |---|---|---|
   | `m_aPropertySpawns` | per-turn unit spawn — an arrival outside normal creation | **the grants machine** |
   | `m_iNumUnitFullHeal` | discrete per-turn action (fully heals up to N damaged units, `CvCity::doHeal` `:20202`); [json.md §5](../specs/json.md) names a heal as a `repeatable` payload | **the grants machine** |
   | `m_paiHealUnitCombatTypeVolume` | **continuous heal-RATE contribution**, not a discrete event — consumed at `CvUnit.cpp:6232` (`iTotalHeal += pCity->getHealRate() + pCity->getHealUnitCombatTypeTotal(...)`) | **the MODIFIER heal channel** (alive-with-source ⇒ modifier, the `freeSpecialists` precedent) — F4's unit-side heal channel is built; this is its city-scope deposit |
4. **Scope of "grant" — settled by the §0 scope rule**: arrival-outside-normal-creation decides it. What
   remains is **HOMING, not a data gap: every one of these provisions IS curated** — verified against
   `Assets/Data` + the poco readers — just not into a `grants` block, so `getGrants()` resolves nothing and the
   machine cannot reach them:

   | provision | authored home today | poco reader |

   **The ruling needed is which of these RE-HOME into `grants`** — a data-model change, so it triggers the
   curator update + regen in the same work item
   ([recurate on every decision](../../AGENTS.md#git--delivery)). Two are not merely
   homing: `extraGoody` feeds the goody-hut system that §2 rules OUT, and the advanced-start budget is flagged
   *"parked in identity … pending review"* by `curate_handicap.py:55` — an open curator question in its own right.

   ⚖ **The trait's start CULTURE and bonus starting POPULATION are already SETTLED and are not on that list
   (owner): they are conditional grants living on the FOUNDER** — `grants.culture` / `grants.population` on the
   settler, gated by the trait ([json.md §5](../specs/json.md)). Both are existing numeric-pulse vocabulary, so
   nothing about them was ever an open question.
   ⛔ **They appeared open only because an invented `cityFounding` section was recorded here as their "authored
   home"** — a block that reached this doc, [json.md](../specs/json.md)'s bespoke list, the curator's mapping
   table and `CvTraitInfo`'s readers, so every layer ratified it and each reader in turn found it sanctioned.
   The block does not exist; the settler's considered action IS founding, which is precisely why the payload
   needs no section of its own. What remains is the mechanical re-home of the data + the reader.
5. **Start-era grants applied forever.** `freePopulation` and `FreeStartEra` buildings fire at *every* city
   founding, not at game start — both are in scope per §0; the open question is only which TRIGGER owns them
   (city-founded, not player-init). Grounded evidence for the ruling: legacy fires `freePopulation` at
   `CvCity::init` (`:352`, reading `GC.getGame().getStartEra()`) and `FreeStartEra` at `CvPlayer::found` (`:6257`)
   — both at city-founding. The trigger EXISTS: `SEVT_CITY_FOUNDED` is emitted from `CvPlayer::found`
   (`CvPlayer.cpp:6229`, carrying the founder unit) and consumed by the machine (`gr_resolveCityFounded`), so
   these hang on it the moment the data is authored. **The remaining blocker is CURATION (§5.4), not an emit** —
   neither provision is in a `grants` block, so `getGrants()` resolves nothing.

   Founding also emits `emitCityOwnerChanged` (`NO_PLAYER`→owner, `CvPlayer.cpp:6228`), completing that surface's
   four sites: founding, `CvCity::read` (the load reseed), `CvPlayer::acquireCity` (`:2692`), and
   `CvPlayer::deleteCity` (`:14755`) — the single dispose/raze choke point.
