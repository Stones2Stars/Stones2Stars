# 7b. The run-from-origin reconciliation — MEASURED engine behaviour

> Part of the **[unit-rendering](../unit-rendering.md)** spec.

**The EXE spawns a unit's scene node at the WORLD ORIGIN — the map centre (`plotXToPointX`'s `-fWidth/2` term) —
and a node keeps believing it is there until it is TOLD a location.** Two things therefore decide whether the
player sees a walk in from mid-map, and the defect has been found in each of them separately:

- **WHETHER the node was ever given a location.** `SetPosition` states where the node IS and animates nothing;
  it is the correct call at every placement moment, and a node that has had one is immune to everything below.
- **WHAT the DLL says about a node that has NOT had one.** ⛔ **ANY statement is reconciled against the origin
  the node still believes in — the move family holds no special status here.** `QueueMove`/`ExecuteMove` carry
  shown-movement semantics and are the loudest case, but a bare `NotifyEntity` — which passes no plot at all —
  produces the same walk, because the engine animates the unit into the state it was told about FROM where it
  thinks the unit stands.

⛔ **So the defect class is A NODE SPOKEN TO BEFORE IT WAS PLACED**, and it has two halves, both DLL-side and
both preventable:

1. **A MOVE call standing in for a PLACE call.** Prevented by the census in
   [§9](10-the-firaxis-reference-contract.md): `SetPosition` at the two placement moments;
   `QueueMove`/`ExecuteMove` only for real movement (`CvSelectionGroup::groupMove`, `CvUnit::updateCombat`) and
   nowhere else.
2. **A node that NOTHING ever placed.** `setupGraphical` is the only site that places a node during play, and it
   is reached only from `reloadEntity` and `CvMap::afterSwitch` ([§2](02-the-entity-lifecycle.md)) — so any path
   that speaks to the engine WITHOUT passing through one of those two is speaking to whatever state the node was
   left in. `CvUnit::ensureGraphicalPlacement` (`Engine/CvUnit.cpp:362`) is the guarantee: it places a node that
   has never been placed and does nothing to one that has, and it runs before the notification in
   `CvUnit::NotifyEntity` (1675) as well as at the end of `reloadEntity` (359).
3. **A node that WAS placed but had never been SHOWN.** ⛔ **Placing a node at creation does not survive its
   first presentation, because a node is presented from where the ENGINE believes it stands** — and a plot draws
   exactly ONE unit ([§1](01-the-model.md)), so a unit standing under another one holds a correctly-placed node
   that nothing has ever drawn. When the centre verdict finally hands it the plot, the presentation reconciles
   from the origin and the placement made at creation counts for nothing. `CvUnit::placeForPresentation`
   (`Engine/CvUnit.cpp:362`) re-states the position at that assignment (`Engine/CvPlot.cpp:10093-10099`).
   ⚠ It refuses to act inside a movement window: `groupMove` lifts its centre-unit inhibit BETWEEN queueing the
   walk and executing it (`Engine/CvSelectionGroup.cpp:3668`), and a reposition there lands the node on the
   destination before the walk plays — a teleport where the player should have seen a move.

⛔ **THE SELECTED UNIT WAS THE HOLE, AND IT IS THE ONE TO KEEP IN MIND, BECAUSE THE PLAYER ONLY EVER OPERATES ON
A SELECTED UNIT.** `reloadEntity` excludes a selected unit — correctly, because its node must never be destroyed
and rebuilt underneath it ([AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)) — and that exclusion used to swallow the placement
call as well, which the reason never covered. A selected unit's node could then never be placed, and MERGING,
UPGRADING, FORTIFYING and AWAKENING are all performed on the selected unit. Placement therefore sits OUTSIDE the
exclusion (`Engine/CvUnit.cpp:359`); only destroy/create is inside it.

⚑ **The symptoms it produces, so they are recognised rather than re-diagnosed:** a NEWLY CREATED unit walks in
from mid-map (its node is built and set up in one go at birth); a unit that held the shared dummy walks in the
first time it needs a real node; a unit whose node was never placed walks in on a STANCE CHANGE — fortify and
awaken both reach `CvSelectionGroup::setActivityType`, which notifies every unit in the group and passes no plot;
and **a unit that is not its plot's best defender walks in EVERY time selection makes it the centre unit**, which
is the one shape a correct placement at creation cannot cure.

⚖ **THAT LAST ONE READS AS A UNIT-TYPE BUG AND IS NOT ONE — it is a STACK-POSITION bug, and the distinction is
what makes it findable.** WORKERS show it and military units do not, because `getPreferredCenterUnit` ranks on
`getBestDefender` ([§3](03-the-plot-side-choosing-the-centre.md)): a military unit becomes the centre unit at
birth and is presented while its placement is fresh, while a worker stacked under a defender is presented for the
first time only when the player selects it, and again on every later selection. ⇒ Read "only unit type X does it"
as a question about what X's place in the stack is, never about X.

⚠ **Under the dummy-entity system real nodes are created LATE, which is what makes this reachable at all.**
Vanilla creates a node in the ctor and places it at birth `setXY`, so it has no un-presented-node window to get
wrong ([§9](10-the-firaxis-reference-contract.md)). Every S2S run-in traces to a node introduced outside those two
moments.

Other engine behaviour measured on the `[GFX]` scene trace, which stands independently of the above:

- The first presentation fires at the plot's centre-unit assignment: every `notifyEntity` from a stack
  manipulation is followed within ~30-80ms by a `centerUnit` flip and by engine reads of the new centre's state.
  A queued walk survives un-drained — ~23 minutes observed — until such a flip presents it.
- The engine resolves `CvUnit::canMove` / `hasMoved` / `isWaiting` by mangled name (present in the EXE image) and
  reads them at setup and at every centre flip, but the walk is not gated on them: a session answering
  `canMove=false` for every unit still jogged every fresh centre node in.
- Node creation TIMING does not matter (pre-init ctor births under `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_UNIT_ENTITIES=0`, post-init
  sweeps, paced or flooded schedules), and churn makes it worse rather than better: C2C's
  destroy/recreate-per-reload multiplied the runners in both paging modes, because each fresh node gets its own
  first presentation. Both paging modes exhibit it.
- Load-time entity creation is a single-frame burst from the `CvPlayer::setupGraphical` sweep (active-player
  clause), not from the paging walk; `beforeSwitch`/`afterSwitch` does NOT run on a load (zero `destroyEntity`
  lines across load traces).
