# Unit rendering — the pipeline, and graphics paging ON vs OFF

> **⚠ TREE-STATE NOTE:** `Sources/` was reverted to HEAD after the run-from-origin hunt, and **HEAD is
> verified clean — units render in place**. The run-from-origin regression lived entirely in the uncommitted
> experimental tree, which is preserved in a git stash (`run-from-origin hunt: full session source
> experiments`); any piece reintroduced from it is validated against the render-in-place check and against
> the §9 contract before it stays. Sections 2–6 below carry line cites and a few behavioural claims from that
> experimental tree and are being re-aligned to HEAD. §7b (measured engine behaviour of out-of-contract node
> introduction) and §9 (the Firaxis reference contract) are tree-state-independent and authoritative.

> **Reference — how the DLL drives unit graphics today.** The renderer is the closed EXE; the DLL reaches it only
> through the 26 virtuals of `CvDLLEntityIFaceBase` (`Sources/Infrastructure/CvDLLEntityIFaceBase.h:20-48`) and
> the 71 of `CvDLLEngineIFaceBase`. Everything here is what the DLL CALLS and WHEN; what the EXE does with a call
> is stated only where it has been MEASURED on the `[GFX]` spine domain (`Graphics.log`,
> `Sources/UI/CvGraphicsTrace.cpp:141`), and is otherwise listed under §8. Every line number is a citation into
> `Sources/`; the tree outranks this page.
