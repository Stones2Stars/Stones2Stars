# Unit rendering — the pipeline, and graphics paging ON vs OFF

> **⛔ SETUP IS PLACEMENT, MOVEMENT IS MOVEMENT, AND CONFLATING THEM IS THE RUN-FROM-MID-MAP BUG.** The EXE
> spawns a fresh node at the SCENE ORIGIN — the map centre — so a move-family call issued on a node that has not
> been presented yet tells the engine to reconcile origin→plot as a walk the player watches, on a unit that never
> moved. The whole census is therefore a rule: `SetPosition` at the two placement moments
> ([§9](unit-rendering/10-the-firaxis-reference-contract.md)), `QueueMove`/`ExecuteMove` **only** for real
> movement — `CvSelectionGroup::groupMove` and `CvUnit::updateCombat`, and nowhere else.
> ⚠ A REFRESH symptom (one figure of a stack showing, the rest arriving seconds later) is a different question
> from placement and is never answered by putting a move call back; it needs a non-movement mechanism
> ([§8](unit-rendering/09-open-questions-not-decidable-from.md)).

> **Reference — how the DLL drives unit graphics today.** The renderer is the closed EXE; the DLL reaches it only
> through the 26 virtuals of `CvDLLEntityIFaceBase` (`Sources/Infrastructure/CvDLLEntityIFaceBase.h:20-48`) and
> the 71 of `CvDLLEngineIFaceBase`. Everything here is what the DLL CALLS and WHEN; what the EXE does with a call
> is stated only where it has been MEASURED on the `[GFX]` spine domain (`Graphics.log`,
> `Sources/UI/CvGraphicsTrace.cpp:141`), and is otherwise listed under §8. Every line number is a citation into
> `Sources/`; the tree outranks this page.
