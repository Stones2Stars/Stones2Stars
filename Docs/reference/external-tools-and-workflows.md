# External tools & workflows — out-of-tree tooling and side-channel dev workflows

This doc is deliberately narrow. It catalogues the things you reach for *outside* the normal
edit→`Assert build`→validate→playtest loop. Anything that loop already covers lives where it is owned, not
here (single-source — [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)).

## Crash-dump analysis (offline)

An S2S crash writes a minidump to the **BTS root** via `CreateMiniDump`, called from the top-level
`CustomFilter` (installed with `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` in `Sources/Defines/CvGlobals.cpp`). This is
separate from Windows WER's `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps`:

```
C:\Games\Civilization IV Complete\Civ4\Beyond the Sword\MiniDump-*.dmp
```

> **⚖ TWO DUMP POPULATIONS, AND THE NAME IS WHAT KEEPS THEM APART.** `MiniDump-*.dmp` is a **crash** — the
> process died. **`CaughtDump-*.dmp` is NOT a crash**: it is a first-chance exception that something downstream
> caught and handled, written once per session by the vectored handler (`S2SVectoredHandler`, installed via
> `AddVectoredExceptionHandler`). ⛔ Never let one into the crash population — symbolizing a dump of a game that
> never died reads as a crash investigation and is not one.
> ⚑ **Why it exists at all:** the `[EXCEPTION.caught]` line names the faulting module and address, which is never
> enough to say WHO called it. Without a stack a handled access violation is *characterizable and unattributable
> at once* — this closes that gap. It fires for ACCESS_VIOLATION only, and exactly **once** per session: writing a
> dump is expensive and a first-chance AV can sit in a hot path, so a per-occurrence dump would be a stall while
> the second dump of one fault says nothing the first did not. Symbolize it with the same `cdb` flow below.

Other failure artifacts (all under `Documents\My Games\Beyond the Sword\Logs\`):

- Asserts on an `Assert` build → `Asserts.log` + `AssertsJson.log`.
- Python tracebacks → `PythonErr.log`. A `RuntimeError: unidentifiable C++ exception` there is a **C++
  access violation propagated out of a boost.python-wrapped DLL call** (the boost wrapper can't name it).
- ⛔ **BUT AN EVENT-HANDLER FAILURE DOES NOT GO THERE — IT GOES TO `PythonDbg.log`.** BUG catches the
  exception inside its own dispatch and reports it as `TRACE: Error in <event> event handler <bound method …>`,
  so it never reaches the `stderr` redirect that feeds `PythonErr.log`. **Both files matter and neither is a
  superset**: `PythonErr` holds what escaped to stderr, `PythonDbg` holds what BUG caught.
  ⚠ **The measured cost of not knowing this:** a session read `PythonErr` alone, counted ~30 tracebacks, and
  concluded from that count that broken handlers could not be a material cost — while `PythonDbg` held **354**
  for the same period. The ratio is the point: the handler surface is exactly the part the obvious file does
  NOT show, so "the error log is small" proves nothing about handler health.
  ⚑ The useful read is per-EVENT, since one broken read repeats per fire:
  `grep -a "Error in .* event handler" PythonDbg.log | sed -E 's/.*Error in ([a-zA-Z]+) event handler .*(method [A-Za-z]+\.[A-Za-z]+|function [A-Za-z_]+).*/\1  \2/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`

### Symbolize the dump

Use the Store WinDbg's bundled console debugger (`cdb`), **offline**. Civ4 is **32-bit → use the x86
`cdb`**:

```
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WinDbg_*_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\x86\cdb.exe
```

⛔ **`WindowsApps` IS ONLY ENUMERABLE FROM POWERSHELL — that glob does not resolve from bash/Git-Bash**, which
reports the path as missing and reads exactly like "WinDbg is not installed". Find it with
`Get-ChildItem 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps' -Filter cdb.exe -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`, and run
`cdb` from PowerShell too.

Point `-y` at the **local PDB dirs only** (no `srv*` — keeps it offline and fast). The DLL PDB lives at
`Assets\CvGameCoreDLL.pdb` and `Build\<Config>\CvGameCoreDLL.pdb`; `cdb` matches by signature, so list all
configs. EXE frames stay unresolved (no Firaxis symbols) — that's expected; our DLL frames resolve.

- **Faulting stack:**
  `cdb -z <dump> -y "C:\code\s2s\s2s\Assets;C:\code\s2s\s2s\Build\Assert;C:\code\s2s\s2s\Build\Release" -c ".ecxr; kp; q"`
- **Fault detail (address + registers + disasm):**
  `... -c ".exr -1; .ecxr; r; u . L4; q"` — `Parameter[1]` of the exception record is the bad read/write
  address; the disasm line at the IP shows which deref. A read at a tiny address (e.g. `+0x60`, `0x1`) =
  null/garbage pointer deref.

Output is verbose (NatVis unload spam) — filter with `Select-String`.

## External sibling repos / binaries

These live **OUTSIDE this repo** (separate solutions under `c:\code\s2s\`) and are **not** built by the S2S
build chain. They are vendored as prebuilt binaries into `Tools/` (FpkBuilder).

### FpkBuilder — the art-packing tool

`Tools/FpkBuilder.exe` is a **vendored prebuilt binary**; its source is a separate solution at
`c:\code\s2s\FpkBuilder` (.NET 10, single-file self-contained; `src/FpkBuilder/Program.cs`).

- **To change packing:** edit there → `dotnet publish -c Release` → copy
  `bin/Release/net10.0/win-x64/publish/FpkBuilder.exe` over `Tools/FpkBuilder.exe`.
- **Packing model** — driven by `Assets/fpklive_token.txt` (line 1 = HEAD revision at the last full build;
  remaining lines = dirty art files):
  - **No token** → from-scratch build (packs all of `UnpackedArt/` into `C2C0.fpk…C2CN.fpk`).
  - **Token present** → incremental (packs only art changed since the token revision into `C2CPatch*.fpk`;
    base FPKs stay byte-identical until the next from-scratch rebuild).
- `PakBuild /S=<MB>` is the per-FPK size cap, set from `GetFpkMaxSizeMb` (default **95 MB**, in the external
  C# source) to stay under GitHub's 100 MB push limit.
- **CI:** `Tools/CI/DeployBuild.bat` calls `Tools/FpkBuilder.exe` with no args; a commit message containing
  `FPKCLEAN` forces a from-scratch rebuild (`DeployBuild.bat:97`/`:105`).

The in-tree tooling this doc deliberately does **not** restate — go to its owner:

- [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) — **the build wrapper + validators.** `Tools/_Build.ps1` (FastBuild
  wrapper; configs/verbs), `Tools/XmlValidator.exe -a`, `Tools/XMLTools/verify-python-callbacks.py`, and the
  frozen VC7.1/C++03 toolchain facts all live in the root guide's "Build And Test" section.
- [`engine.md`](engine.md) — **why the toolchain is frozen** (the dual Boost
  1.32/1.55 + Python 2.4 stack locked by the closed Firaxis `.exe`), context for the boost.python crash
  signature above.
- [`../../Tools/Migration/README.md`](../../Tools/Migration/README.md) — **the XML→JSON curators**
  (`curate_<entity>.py --write`, `store.py`, `engine.py` and its `--write` superseded-emitter footgun). The
  operational runner reference; the model lives in the cascade specs.

  The `readjson` harness (`Tools/ReadJson/`) is the in-DLL JSON loader's offline driver, exercised by the

- [`spine.md`](../spine.md) — **the live surveillance surface** the crash/known-
  issue debugging reads against (HTTP `127.0.0.1:7227`, `/events`, the four `/computed` censuses, and the
  gated logs) → [the Orwell observability bar](../spine/07-what-to-log-the-orwell-bar-the.md#the-reconstruction-bar-orwell). Delegate bulk data reads to the
  `data-reader` sub-agent rather than pulling raw dumps into context.
