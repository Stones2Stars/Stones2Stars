The stored aggregate rides events, exactly like the rest of the spine; a missed event drifts it, but that is the
event spine's **baseline invariant** (plot-groups and vicinity drift the same way if events are incomplete), not a
context-specific weakness. There is **no blanket per-turn rebuild** and no recompute-on-read.

⛔ **AND NOTHING HEALS A MISS — that is what makes incomplete wiring safe to grow.** No periodic or per-turn
context refresh, no "rebuild if it looks stale", no lazy recompute-on-read when a store looks empty, no staleness-timer
sweep, no validity/epoch stamp that triggers re-derivation, and no "recompute once per turn to be safe" backstop —
not as a safety net, not transitionally, not "just for load". If a store ever seems to need a "make sure it's
current" call, that is a **missing fact to report**, never a recompute to add — the full reasoning (why a missing
emit is the failure that should survive) is § A SELF-HEAL IS THE
FOSSIL OF A MISSING EMIT, above ([self-heal is not a backstop](03-no-staleness-no-selfheal.md#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban); CAPSTONE — LOAD is the only full build).

- **`PlotContext`'s verdict bitset** ← the plot-substrate DOMAIN facts — terrain / feature / improvement / route /
  bonus / owner / **plot type / river / irrigation / landmark / worked** — consumed by `PlotContext` ITSELF
  ([a context dictionary is a spine consumer](11-context-stores-vs-forwards.md#what-a-context-stores-vs-forwards---a-context-is-an-event-built-store-not-a-forwarding-facade)), which sets the bits the announcing fact FEEDS
  and nothing else.
  > **⚖ THE ROUTING IS DERIVED FROM A PER-BIT TABLE, never hand-written per event.** Each bit declares its own

  > new bit is one row; a new fact is one axis.
  > **⚖ HAS_COAST IS SYMMETRIC: LAND WITH ADJACENT WATER, *OR WATER WITH ADJACENT LAND*.** Off the stored

  > ⚑ **And it is what deletes the deferred-drain machinery.** The only reason the old derivation touched `CvArea`

- **`EmpireContext.policies`** ← the **civic / trait / player-init DOMAIN facts**, consumed by the policy store
  itself, which applies each grantor's policy block as a DELTA — never a refill, which would recount every time
  and so hide the multi-grantor case the count exists for. It is the single
  source the one policy read (`ev_playerHasPolicy`) uses — reads never re-walk the grantors. The **player-init** fact
  is load-bearing on its own: a player's INITIAL traits are written straight into the has-array rather than through
  the trait setter, so that fact is the only announcement they ever make.
  ⛔ It is deliberately **not** maintained from `CvPlayer::setCivics` / `setHasTrait`: a direct hook beside an event
  is a second maintenance surface for one fact, and the fact already exists.
  ⚑ **This store is the ONE home of the per-flag policy verdicts** — the boolean getters (`isNoForeignTrade`,
  `isStateReligion`, `isInquisitionConditions` and their kin) read `has`, and the AI civic-value what-ifs read
  `count` with an unconditional vacuum subtraction of the option slot's own civic. The serialized per-flag
  counters `processCivics`/`processTrait` once pushed beside it were the second-surface class and are cut
  ([the uniform legacy-accumulator cut](03-no-staleness-no-selfheal.md#-the-legacy-accumulator-cut--every-accumulator-one-uniform-mechanism)); their changers' side-effect riders
  live at the adoption site (`setCivics`), diff-gated on the policy actually moving. Genuine non-cascade state
  on that same class (the revolution index, `changeMaxConscript`, `changeSpecialistValidCount`, hurry counts)
  stays serialized as-is.
- **The HELD-TRAIT set** ← the **same trait / player-init facts**, consumed by its own store beside the policy one
  (one dictionary per area of responsibility — the `TRAIT_` and `POLICY_` key spaces are disjoint registries).
  > **⚖ IT IS THE CASE WHERE ONE AXIS SPLITS ACROSS THE SCAN-vs-HOP TEST, and reading the FORWARD row as settling

- **AREAS are announced WHOLESALE.** `CvMap::recalculateAreas` clears every plot's area, empties the area list and
  recalculates, so it emits **`SEVT_AREAS_RECALCULATED`** (no payload — the fact IS "all of them") and every holder
  of an area id re-reads. Areas are virtually never recalculated (terrain levelled to sea level — the WMD mechanic —
  plus map generation), so the blanket costs nothing at its real frequency, and it is **not** the banned self-heal: a
  wholesale identity reassignment is not addressable per-source, so no finer route exists to derive
  ([self-heal is not a backstop](03-no-staleness-no-selfheal.md#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban) bans papering over a MISSED invalidation, not announcing a
  genuine wholesale one).
- **Forwarded** fields need no maintenance — they read the live source.
- **Load** — `EmpireContext.policies` rebuilds from the **in-read civic/trait/player-init emits** as they stream (a
  derived aggregate recomputes from source on load, [derived data is never trusted from a save](../specs/save.md#5-derived-data-serializes-nothing-),
  never trusted from a save) — through the consumer, not a second build mechanism beside the event stream.
  `CityContext`'s other blocks build once at `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED`, because each reads state that is only complete when
  the whole stream has ended (the areas deserialize after the plots). That single pass IS the load build — the only
  full build there is — after which the facts alone maintain them.
  ⚑ The VICINITY dictionaries, `onSite` included, are not among them: they seed through the ORDINARY membership
  route, because re-establishing each city's work area announces one `SEVT_PLOT_WORKABLE_BY_ADDED` per plot and the
  applier folds that tile's CURRENT bonus and served resource. One route, both jobs — no separate build pass to keep
  in step ([the load reseed](../spine/05-the-load-reseed.md#5-the-load-reseed): never a second build mechanism beside the event stream).
  `CityContext.plotAttrs` builds from the in-read DOMAIN events
  ([the load reseed](../spine/05-the-load-reseed.md#5-the-load-reseed)): each `CvPlot::read` announces its deserialized working-city
  fact (`SEVT_PLOT_WORKING_CITY_ADDED / _REMOVED` — the genuine read site emits), and `CityContext`'s own consumer
  BUFFERS the load bracket's membership facts and folds them through the one applier
  (`CvCity::onCityPlotChanged`) at `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED` — the cities stream AFTER the map, so the fold applies once
  after the stream ends (the [enabler §7.1](../specs/enabler.md) order rule's second option, never the mixed form).
  ⚠ **The buffer is an ORDERING fact, not a staleness mechanism** — there is no city to fold into while the map
  streams. The per-bit facts need no such treatment and are simply dropped inside the bracket: by the drain every
  plot has announced its substrate, so the fold reads FINAL bits and applying them earlier would only count them
  twice. There is never a blanket per-turn recompute.
