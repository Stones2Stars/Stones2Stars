# What a context STORES vs FORWARDS — ⛔ a context is an EVENT-BUILT STORE, not a forwarding facade

> Part of the **[cascade](../cascade.md)** spec.

**"Context should be built on events — that is the design of it."** And the purpose of storing is that the state
becomes DISTINGUISHABLE, so an info can say it will actually deliver this, based on this state.
A context that merely forwards to its bound object delivers none of that — it is the same pointer hop with an
extra name, so the design collapses into "pass the god-object like always."

> **⚖ THERE SHOULD VIRTUALLY NEVER BE AN ORDERING PROBLEM — EVERYTHING IS POPULATED BY THE REPLAY OF SPINE
> EVENTS.** That is what makes consumer registration order almost irrelevant: each consumer builds its
> own state from the SAME fact stream, so no consumer waits on another's build.

> survives ONLY for state no derivation can produce); a context never stores the second kind.

The split is by **DERIVED vs RAW**, not by convenience:

- **STORE — every DERIVED fact the evaluation reads.** Predicate verdicts, aggregates, unions: computed ONCE by
  the ONE derivation for that fact and maintained by the spine events, never recomputed at read. This is the
  context's substance. It is derived state, so it is **never serialized** and is rebuilt at load by the reseed
  ([derived data is never trusted from a save](../specs/save.md#5-derived-data-serializes-nothing-), [the load reseed](../spine/05-the-load-reseed.md#5-the-load-reseed)).
- **FORWARD — only the object's OWN RAW data** that it already maintains O(1) (the substrate ids a parameterized
  predicate keys on, population, …). Forwarding raw data is not duplication; storing a second copy of it would be.

⚑ **THE PAYOFF — this is why the design earns its cost: once contexts are PURELY event-updated, an
enormous class of per-read CALCULATION becomes obsolete.** Not "gets faster" — ceases to exist. Every read-time
scan/union/walk collapses into a stored value some event already maintained, and reads become bare fetches
(§ THE MAINTAINED SUM, above; [turn time is king](16-package-model.md#-the-per-scope-package-model--the-cascades-founding-design-1-stated-as-cache-architecture)).
The in-tree exhibits are not hypothetical: `isCoastalLand()` is an 8-neighbour scan **per predicate
evaluation**, and the §5a vicinity check is a radius union **per check**. The win is STRUCTURAL: once the fact
is stored there is no read-time work left to do, so cost tracks EVENT volume (what changed), never read volume
(how often it is asked) — and it is observed where every performance claim is observed, on the per-turn wall
clock ([turn time is king](16-package-model.md#-the-per-scope-package-model--the-cascades-founding-design-1-stated-as-cache-architecture)).

⛔ **BUT THE TEST IS A SCAN, NOT A HOP — and `getNumBonuses` is the case that marks the line.** What earns a
store is read-time work that GROWS with something (neighbours, radius tiles, a registry). A read that resolves
through a POINTER to the object which already owns the number O(1) is not that, and storing it anyway makes a
third copy of one fact ([enabler.md §8](../specs/enabler.md) RESIDENCY: the plot group owns the network count,
the city relays it, the context forwards the relay). ⚠ This one had a store on exactly that mistaken reading,
and it cost a sweep of every bonus on every fact that could move one — strictly more work than the hop it was
avoiding. **Ask what the read WALKS; if the answer is "one pointer", forward it.**

> **⛔ SO A CONSUMER NEVER WALKS AN INFO'S KEYED LIST TO ASK A PER-ITEM LIVE-STATE QUESTION — THE EVENT-BUILT
> READ-ONLY STATE ANSWERS IT.** *"There should be no iterating like that; the eventspine-built read-only
> should be able to handle that."* The shape to recognise is `foreach_(key in someInfo.getKeyedList()) { …
> liveStateRead(key) … }` — the info supplies the keys and the loop asks the live state once per key. That is the
> per-read scan this whole section deletes, merely sourced from an info instead of from the map.
> ⚑ **The worked case is the corporation's consumed bonuses:** `foreach_(bonus in corp's bonuses) getNumBonuses(bonus)`
> re-executes [enabler.md §8](../specs/enabler.md)'s hottest cluster once PER BONUS, and where the question is a
> MAGNITUDE the answer is already authored — the rate carries a `per:{anyOf: consumed bonuses}` scaler, so the
> valuation resolves rate × count in one call and the loop simply disappears.
> ⛔ **And renaming the receiver is NOT the fix.** A walk that compiles against the new getter reads as migrated
> while doing exactly what it did before — the half-migration
> ([build a new getter surface, never widen a legacy one](../architecture/patterns/05-the-two-read-roles-one-grammar-two.md#-the-two-read-roles--one-grammar-two-answers)), and it hides the hole the maintained read has
> not yet filled ([legacy must fail loud, never mask a cascade gap](../specs/validation.md#legacy-must-fail-loud-never-mask-a-cascade-gap)). Leave such a site DANGLING as the
> census entry it is until the maintained fetch exists.

⛔ **A forwarded read that COMPUTES is the defect this rule exists to kill.** `PlotContext::hasCoast()` forwarding
to `CvPlot::isCoastalLand()` — an 8-neighbour scan with an `area()->getNumTiles()` call per neighbour, on every
predicate evaluation — is the worked example, and it directly contradicts
[patterns.md](../architecture/patterns.md): *"every evaluator predicate is an O(1) CONTEXT fetch … a predicate that walks
plots/units per call is the efficiency defect to reject in review."*

**The storage is keyed by the CONDITION VOCABULARY** — that is what makes the state distinguishable. One key
space (`CASC_PRED_*` / the classification ids), three granularities of the same design:

| context | stores | granularity |
|---|---|---|
| **PlotContext** | the plot's own predicate verdicts | a `CASC_PRED_*` BITSET |
| **CityContext** | `plotAttrs` | per-predicate COUNTS over the same keys — the FOLD of its member plots' bits |
| **EmpireContext** | `policies` | the `POLICY_*` id set (the union over live civics + held traits) |

So the city aggregate is not a second derivation: `CvCity::onCityPlotChanged(plot, ±1)` folds the plot's bits,
and the two granularities cannot drift.

⚠ **Adjacency-derived predicates fan out.** `HAS_COAST` / fresh-water depend on NEIGHBOURS, so the event that
changes a plot re-derives that plot's own bits AND its adjacent plots' adjacency bits. Bounded (8 neighbours) and
event-driven — never a read-time scan, and never left on the old accessor as an interim.

| context | owner | STORES (unique aggregate) | FORWARDS (read through the bound object / its owner) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CityContext** | `CvCity` | `plotAttrs` — per-predicate plot COUNTS (the fold of member plots' bits) · **`amenities`** — the `AMENITY_*` id→COUNT fold over the city's OPERATING buildings + the empire-scope grantors (json §8; the count is load-bearing — see the callout below) · **the VICINITY BONUSES available in the city** — the §5a radius union, MAP half (see the split below) · the **AREA facts** (area id, its tile count, the coastal water-body size) · the **holy-city and HEADQUARTERS counts** — how many religions / corporations name this city, each a delta store fed ±1 by its own fact · the **CORPORATION-ACTIVE verdicts** — the remembered per-corp `{HAS_CORPORATION}` verdict, held ONLY so its crossing can announce (`SEVT_CITY_CORPORATION_ACTIVE_ADDED / _REMOVED`, the fact plane C routes on): each leg's fact triggers a re-read of the ONE engine implementation (`CvCity::isActiveCorporation`, the sanctioned engine-owned input — the read side stays the live forward), and a re-read that moved nothing announces nothing | population, power, religion presence, holy-city-of, corporation, capital, government-centre, fresh-water access, property value (raw, `CvCity`-owned, O(1)); state religion (→ owner `CvPlayer`); **the TRADED count** — the gated network number, forwarded through `CvCity::getNumBonuses`, which relays to the PLOT GROUP that owns it ([enabler.md §8](../specs/enabler.md) RESIDENCY: nothing mirrors the group); **the CURRENT REALIZED YIELDS** — the city's own O(1) group read, forwarded so a valuation can resolve a percent against a real base (below); **the CURRENT REALIZED COMMERCE** — `CvCity::getCommerces`, the per-commerce SPLIT of that commerce yield by the empire's sliders plus each channel's own deposits (§2a), forwarded for the same reason |
| **EmpireContext** | `CvPlayer` | `policies` — the empire's enacted-policy set (the derived UNION over live civics'/traits' policy blocks, stored nowhere else) · **the HELD-TRAIT set** — the `TRAIT_` id→COUNT fold, a delta store fed ±1 by the trait facts (§ the callout below: enumerating what a player holds is a SCAN even though testing one trait is a hop) | state religion (single enum → `CvPlayer::getStateReligion`), civics/**trait presence**/heritages, the team-held facts; **the CURRENT REALIZED COMMERCE** — `CvPlayer::getCommerces`, the four empire RECEIVER totals: the city-yields forward's empire twin, so an empire-scope percent resolves against a real base; **the COMMERCE SLIDER PERCENTAGES** — the player's gold / research / culture / espionage rates, the `GOLD_RATE`/`RESEARCH_RATE`/`CULTURE_RATE`/`ESPIONAGE_RATE` tokens ([json.md §3.1](../specs/json.md)); a group keyed by `CommerceTypes`, forwarded because `CvPlayer` owns them O(1) |
| **PlotContext** | `CvPlot` | the `CASC_PRED_*` verdict **BITSET** — the OWN-PLOT block (water/land/relief/hills/peak/river/irrigation/feature-present/landmark/owned/**worked**) plus the ADJACENCY block (coast, fresh-water) · **`workableBy`** — the cities whose potential work area this plot is in, set by `CvCity::changeWorkableArea` and announced per plot (§ the VICINITY store) | the RAW substrate a parameterized predicate keys on — terrain/feature/improvement/route/bonus ids, owner, latitude, nature yield — plus city-presence, the one verdict with no mutation event a bit could be maintained from (→ `CvPlot`); **the plot's CURRENT REALIZED YIELDS** — `CvPlot::getYields`, the whole isolated per-plot base package as a bare cache fetch. ⛔ The PRE-IMPROVEMENT leg (`natureYield`) is a SECOND SLOT of that same package, never a per-call computation: it is asked per (plot × improvement × yield) by the placement gate and both improvement valuations, which is the cost class this whole section deletes. A read that recomputes it is the forwarded-read-that-COMPUTES defect above, and the number is already in the package |

⛔ **THE VICINITY SPLIT — the context holds the MAP half, the enabler holds the BUILDING half.** The §5a in-vicinity
supply is a union of two independently-owned halves, and storing either one twice is the duplication the model bans:

- **MAP providers** (a bonus on a radius tile providing itself) are per-scope live state with no other home, so
  `CityContext` holds them — tiered by the §3.4 ownership discriminator (`owned` / owned+neutral / `crossBorder` /
  `worked`), since the `vicinity` band selects which tiles count — the plot-set axis, distinct from `connection`.
- **ACTIVE BUILDING providers** (`provides.bonuses`) are the operate/provides **least fixpoint**, which only the
  enabler can resolve — an operate condition may consume a bonus another active building provides. They stay
  `OperatingBuildings::provided`, reached through `CvCascadeEvalCtx::vicinityProvidedBonuses`.

The reader unions the two. A mirror of the building half on the context would also *drift*, because the enabler
mutates its set in place as the fixpoint ripples.

> **⚖ THE MAP HALF IS TWO DICTIONARIES, NOT ONE — bonuses, and natural features.** There is nothing wrong with two dictionaries, one for bonuses and one for natural features; what I don't want is the constant
> rewalk."* So the vicinity store is a **`BONUS_*`-keyed** dictionary beside a **`CASC_PRED_*`-keyed** one (the

> ⛔ **They are NOT merged into one dictionary**, and the reason is the one `ContextDict` already states as its

> ⚠ **The ownership TIERS partition; they do not nest in storage.** [json.md §3.4](../specs/json.md) defines

>
> **⚖ NEUTRAL IS THE DEFAULT STATE — IF THERE IS NO OWNER IT IS NEUTRAL.** So neutral is **not stored and

> ⚑ **That is what makes the store maintainable at all.** `SEVT_PLOT_OWNER_ADDED / _REMOVED` are both guarded on

⚖ **`CityContext.amenities` — THE CITY'S OWN FEATURE LIST, AND THE CITY IS WHAT GETS CHECKED.** A
grantor's `amenities` block ([json.md §8](../specs/json.md)) is static info data; what a consumer actually asks
is *"does THIS CITY have this?"*. So the city holds the FOLD — over its **operating** buildings, plus the
empire-scope grantors (civic / trait / tech) that reach every city — and every gate reads it O(1). ⛔ A consumer
must never loop the city's buildings asking each one, and a grantor's per-key named getter is not the consumer
surface: the fold is the ONE reader of the grantor side
([the DRY single-implementation law](../architecture/patterns/03-dry-one-implementation-per.md#dry--one-implementation-per-calculation--evaluation-the-single-source-law)), alongside display/pedia.

**Every boolean city attribute of this shape is generalized onto the ONE fold, not just power:**

all ordinary `CITY_HAS_AMENITY` keys (`CvCity::isGovernmentCenter` / `isNoUnhappiness` /
`isNoUnhealthyPopulation` / `isBuildingOnlyHealthy`), so a NEW attribute of this shape costs no engine
change — it is pure data, the open-registry promise ([the classification-infos registry](../specs/json/09-classification-unit-skillstagsstate-building-a.md#8-classification--unit-skillstagsstate-building-attributes--empire-capabilities))
reaching the consumer side. ⛔ There is no surviving hand-named counter for any of them — no
`changeGovernmentCenterCount` / `changeNoUnhappinessCount` / `changeNoUnhealthyPopulationCount` member on
`CvCity` — the fold replaced them, exactly what
[every derived cache is one shape](04-derived-stores.md#-every-derived-store-is-one-shape--a-keyed-accumulator-maintained-by-a-delta) asks for.

⚠ **Two attributes that LOOK like the same family are deliberately NOT on this fold, and neither is a hole to
close by routing it there.** `governmentCenterDistance()` is a separately STORED value (§ the sanctioned-recalc
exemplar, below) because it answers a MIN over the player's centres — a different question from
`isGovernmentCenter()`, which the amenity fold already answers. And `HAS_FRESHWATER` is a **`PlotContext`** bit,
not a `CityContext` amenity, that deliberately keeps calling the live `CvPlot::isFreshWater` engine predicate
rather than folding onto a dictionary (§ the adjacency callout, below —
[the DRY single-implementation law](../architecture/patterns/03-dry-one-implementation-per.md#dry--one-implementation-per-calculation--evaluation-the-single-source-law)).

**Pass by reference/pointer, never by value.** Passing a bound context is far cheaper than snapshotting
values; a context is never a value copy — that is *why* it forwards rather than mirrors.

**⚖ THE TWO PASS-IN SCENARIOS — a context crosses a call boundary in exactly TWO places, the two
condition-evaluation sites:** (1) **the VALUATION** — the `expected*` per-group reads and the package rebuild's
conditioned-deposit evaluation (the same machinery at event cadence); (2) **the `requires` edge** — the
enabler's build/operate gate incl. the operating-set fixpoint, re-run at HAVE-change over the affected
candidates. Both go through the ONE evaluator over the eval ctx the contexts fill. Every other read on every
surface is a straight compiled fetch and NEVER takes a context parameter — a context in any other signature is
the mechanical smell that condition evaluation (or an ad-hoc state reach) is happening where it doesn't belong.
