# The coherent surface — grouped storage, parameterized getters (CLARITY AND PREDICTABILITY IS KING)

> Part of the **[04-the-info-data-out-contract-what-an](../04-the-info-data-out-contract-what-an.md)** spec.

The numbers and the booleans are **organized into named groups, each read by ONE getter parameterized over the
group's natural index** — never N individual getters for a groupable set. This is the whole shape of a sane info;
`getYield(YIELD)` is right, `getFoodYield()`/`getProductionYield()`/… is the disease, and so is
`isNukeImmune()`/`isZoneOfControl()`/… for the boolean blocks.

- **The AUTHORED form is the JSON anatomy; the ANATOMY WALK IS LOAD-ONLY.** The [json.md §6](../../../specs/json.md)
  deposit model — per family, the [§3.9](../../../specs/json.md) entries under their FULL five-axis address
  `<family>.<scope>[.<target>|.<targetType>.{TARGET}][.<member>].<unit>` — is what the reader parses, with
  **every string key interned to a typed id** (family/member → the shared kind-enum vocabulary, scope → the
  scope enum, named-entity targets → FK-resolved ids, conditions → parsed trees;
  [materialize at mapFrom](../07-materialize-at-mapfrom-no-runtime.md#materialize-at-mapfrom--no-runtime-string-reads-in-info-getters-the-single-source-laws-load-time-sibling)), nothing flattened away, the §3.9
  mechanism UNREDUCED (`per`, the `ai` sibling, the `enabled`/`disabled` twin trees in their spec'd order —
  `enabled` first, a holding `disabled` OVERRIDES; a plural-target filter is the entry's own `enabled`
  predicate, [json.md §6.1](../../../specs/json.md)).
- **The ONE load COMPILE pass walks those entries ONCE and produces the runtime forms — after load, nothing
  ever walks the anatomy.** A **null-condition entry's value folds STRAIGHT into its group's compiled member
  array** — the enum-keyed `[kind × family-scope-set]` unconditioned ×100 sums, the grouped member pattern,
  scope-free kind names (Σflat vs Σpercent separate slots — the unit is part of the slot key,
  [modifier.md §2](../../../cascade.md)). A **conditioned entry** lands in the group's compiled conditioned
  list, its condition tree prebuilt, evaluated ONLY at event-driven package rebuild and the per-decision
  `expected*` read — never re-parsed, never re-derived. Classification compiles to JSON-derived bitsets
  (`m_attributes` / `m_capabilities` / `m_skills` / `m_policies`); edges to the load-populated forward/reverse
  families ([reverse lookups are populated once, at load](../../../cascade/01-deposit-and-read.md#1-one-step-deposit-down-accumulate-read-o1)); intrinsic lone values to plain typed
  members. No string, no parse node, and no anatomy tree survives into a runtime read path.
- **⛔ THE SCOPE AXIS — a kind-enum names its CONCEPT ONLY; scope is a separate dimension**
  ([scope is a separate axis, never folded into the kind](#the-coherent-surface--grouped-storage-parameterized-getters-clarity-and-predictability-is-king)). Scope is its own axis of the deposit address + a
  spelled-out getter parameter, NEVER a fragment of an enum, member, or getter name — a scope word (`GLOBAL`,
  `ALL_CITY`, `WORLD`, `AREA`, …) inside a kind name collapses two of the address's axes into bespoke per-pair
  entries. `getDefense(DEFENSE_AMOUNT, SCOPE_CITY)` — kind and scope are separate arguments, exactly as the
  JSON's own `<family>.<scope>.<member>` separates them.
- **⚖ THE DECISION PROTOCOL IS TWO STAGES, IN ORDER: ask the ENABLER what is possible, then ask the CASCADE
  what happens if you do it.** Every AI decision is that pair — the ENABLER narrows to the
  candidates ([enabler.md §6](../../../specs/enabler.md): the frontier is the shared choice set, iterated instead of
  the entity database), and the CASCADE values each survivor through the what-if. ⛔ Neither half substitutes
  for the other: scoring what cannot be done wastes the expensive half on candidates the cheap half would have
  dropped, and gating without valuing picks an option the AI cannot weigh. ⚑ **This is what makes the what-if
  affordable at all** — it runs over a small maintained set, never over everything.
- **THE WHAT-IF DRIVER — the AI's planning asks are STRAIGHT RESPONSES, 0 calculation.** The two
  most-asked questions in the engine both answer from compiled structures: *"what can I do next after getting
  this?"* is the FUNDAMENTAL enabler-tree read — the info's load-compiled `enables`/reverse edge families + the
  enabler's maintained domain vectors, a pure list fetch ([enabler.md §7](../../../specs/enabler.md): every read is an
  O(1) lookup that never calls a calculator; the tree is conditional-free by design). **The ONE calculation in
  that whole flow is the `requires` gate** — very few things have a single prerequisite, so a newly-proposed
  candidate is confirmed against its remaining prerequisites — **and it runs at HAVE-CHANGE time**, over only the
  affected candidates via the `EDGEF_REQUIRED_BY` re-gate ([enabler.md §7.1](../../../specs/enabler.md)), never at ask
  time: when the AI asks, the verdict already sits in the tri-state vector. *"What do I gain from building
  this?"* fetches the compiled unconditioned sums straight — one load per slot — and only the compiled
  CONDITIONED tail is ever evaluated (through the ONE evaluator against the contexts,
  [contexts.md](../../../cascade.md)), at per-decision cadence in the `expected*` read. The entity-level active/dormant
  verdict stays the ENABLER's, fed in via the precomputed operating set — a what-if read never re-evaluates
  `requires`.
- **THE GETTER SETUP — one exemplar shape for every info (the aim). Four read categories, nothing else:**
  1. **Sections** — whole typed objects the enabler + grants/provides machinery read: `getRequires()` /
     `getEdges()` / `getAllowed()` / `getGrants()` / `getProvides()` / `getWhenObsolete()`.
  2. **Classification** — O(1) bitset tests, the **name encoding hold-vs-provide** (json.md §8): what the
     entity HAS is `hasAttribute(id)`/`hasAttributes()` (building) and `hasSkill(id)`/`hasTag(id)` (unit); what it
     PROVIDES to something else is `providesCapability(id)`/`providesCapabilities()` (to the empire) and
     `providesSkill(id)` (a grantor handing a skill on).
     > **⛔ THE PARAMETERIZED READ IS THE CONSUMER SURFACE — a consumer NEVER asks for a key by name.** A
     > consumer asks `kUnitInfo.hasSkill(CLS_SKILL_BLITZ)`; the id is a compile-time constant from the
     > **generated** `Infos/CvClassificationIds.h`. Seven reads on `CvInfo` cover every domain
     > (`hasSkill` / `hasTag` / `hasAttribute` / `providesAmenity` / `hasCharacteristic` / `providesCapability` /
     > `providesPolicy`, plus `revokesSkill` for the §4 revoke plane), each a NULL-safe `clsHasId` over the
     > block — so a block-less info answers FALSE and the read is total.
     > ⛔ **A new authored key is a REGENERATED TABLE ENTRY, never a new function.** Do not add a named getter,
     > and do not re-introduce a per-key read class: that shape is what this replaced.
     > ⚑ **How the open registry still hands out a compile-time id:** the blocker was the id ORDER being
     > DISCOVERED at load, not the openness. `Tools/Migration/curate_classification_ids.py` pins the order (as
     > `curate_order.py` pins `_order.json`); `ClassificationRegistry::buildAndResolve` SEEDS from that table
     > before minting, so the constant IS the runtime id. The category stays OPEN
     > ([the classification-infos registry](../../../specs/json/09-classification-unit-skillstagsstate-building-a.md#8-classification--unit-skillstagsstate-building-attributes--empire-capabilities)): an unlisted key still mints at load,
     > appended after the seeded block — regenerating just promotes it to a constant, save-neutral since nothing
     > serializes.
     > ⚠ **The constants carry a reserved `CLS_` namespace** (`CLS_TAG_MILITARY`) distinct from the runtime
     > INFOTYPE STRING (`TAG_MILITARY`): the property engine owns global `TagTypes`/`AttributeTypes` in
     > `CvEnums.h`, and an OPEN registry could otherwise collide with any engine enumerator.
     > ⚑ A **spec-named key that no data authors yet** (skills.md §1/§2 headroom — `noSelfHeal`, `freeDrop`, …) is
     > seeded from the generator's `HEADROOM` list so a legitimate consumer still compiles and reads false, until
     > data authors it.
     >
     > ⛔ **THE INFO-SIDE NAMED `CLS_HAS` BODIES ARE GONE TOO — the whole per-key shape is retired, both halves.**
     > ⚠ The names permanently COLLIDE with live game-object methods: `isCapital` is a building AMENITY *and*
     > `CvCity::isCapital`; `isNukeImmune` is a building amenity, a plot-substrate CHARACTERISTIC *and*
     > `CvUnit::isNukeImmune`; `isGovernmentCenter` is an amenity *and* a `CvCity` method. The RECEIVER decides
     > which one a call site means, never the name — a textual sweep destroys the game-object half. Convert
     > receiver-by-receiver, with an allowlist of info-typed receivers.
     >
     > **⚖ AND FOR AN AMENITY THE RECEIVER IS THE QUESTION ITSELF (json.md §8, [contexts.md](../../../cascade.md)).** An
     > amenity is CITY-HELD, grantor-PROVIDED: *"does THIS CITY have it"* is answered by the city's FOLD
     > (`CityContext::hasAmenity`), never by asking a grantor — re-pointing such a gate at
     > `kBuilding.providesAmenity(...)` would leave it unchanged while reading as migrated. ⚑ The converse holds
     > for most sites: an AI VALUATION and a FOLD APPLY (`processBuilding`) legitimately ask the GRANTOR, since
     > the candidate's own block IS the answer there. Classify by the QUESTION: gate → the city; valuation/apply/
     > display → the grantor.
  3. **Modifier groups — three reads per group, all over the LOAD-COMPILED forms:**
     - the **straight point read** over the compiled unconditioned sum — `getDefense(DefenseKind eKind,
       ScopeKind eScope)` → one array load, **0 calculation** (kind and scope separate arguments,
       [scope is a separate axis, never folded into the kind](#the-coherent-surface--grouped-storage-parameterized-getters-clarity-and-predictability-is-king));
     - the **compiled conditioned list** (`defenseConditioned()` / `yieldConditioned()` / … — the typed entries
       with prebuilt condition trees; what the package rebuild, the pedia, and the valuation walk);
     - the **what-if valuation** — the [contexts.md](../../../cascade.md) per-GROUP endpoints
       (`expectedFlatYields(cityContext, empireContext, plotGroup, flatYields)` and siblings): the compiled
       sums fetched straight PLUS the group's conditioned tail through the ONE evaluator, `plots`-targets scaled
       by `cityContext.plotAttrs`, scopes folded into the experienced-here answer, the active/dormant verdict fed
       from the enabler. This IS the AI's *"what do I gain from building this?"* read.
  4. **Intrinsic** — bare typed reads (`getAirlift`, the shrine/corpHQ FKs, flavours), plus `getScalar(SCALAR_X)`
     for the 1–2-entry stragglers (genuinely lone unconditioned values).
     > **⛔ A TEXT read NAMES WHICH SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY IT IS ON — `*Key()` returns a TXT_KEY, the bare form
     > returns RESOLVED TEXT.** A text naming must specify that a KEY is being fetched rather than the actual
     > text, so it is unambiguous which of the two a call site holds. TXT is an
     > unmigrated system the JSON only REFERENCES ([json.md §7](../../../specs/json.md)), so an INFO holds keys and
     > resolution belongs to the text manager; a name that hides which one you are holding is how a raw key ends
     > up rendered to a player, or a resolved string ends up fed back into `getText`.
     > ⚑ The convention is already the tree's: `getCivilopediaKey`/`getHelpKey`/`getStrategyKey`/
     > `getShortDescriptionKey`/`getAdjectiveKey` return keys beside the `DllExport` bare forms that return text.
     > ⚠ The four bare EXE-bound reads (`getTextKeyWide`, `getDescription`, `getText`, `getHelp` on
     > `CvInfoBase`) are FIXED BY ABI and are not renameable — check `DllExport` before proposing any text
     > rename ([engine.md § Is a symbol really EXE-bound?](../../../reference/engine.md)).
  5. **The per-entry TEXT render (so that tooltips work properly)** — every compiled entry renders
     itself as ONE localized detail line (`+25%<hammer> — while Coal connected`), the `detailLines` pattern
     of the combat calculator (`CvCombatModel::computeCombatPreview`'s itemised per-modifier breakdown),
     through ONE shared renderer ([the DRY single-implementation law](../03-dry-one-implementation-per.md#dry--one-implementation-per-calculation--evaluation-the-single-source-law)) — the
     tooltip/pedia composers consume rendered entry lines, never hand-assemble from getters. Cold path:
     spell-back segments + TXT keys are the honest cost there. **Structural consequence: the compiled entry
     list is COMPLETE — unconditioned entries are RETAINED as entries** (the folded sums are the derived fast
     plane beside them, never a replacement) — per-entry text and per-entry attribution both require the list.

     > **⛔ THE FLAT YIELDS ARE ONE LINE; THE CONDITIONALS COME SEPARATELY.** "One line per entry" is the
     > grammar, not the DENSITY: a PLAIN flat channel amount says everything it has to say in a glyph and a
     > number, so the whole set is gathered onto a single line — `+2<food> +1<hammer> +3<commerce>` — which is
     > what a player scans for and what legacy showed. An entry that CARRIES something keeps its own line,
     > because the carried half is the part worth reading (`+25%<hammer> — while Coal connected`).
     > ⚑ **PLAIN means nothing qualifies it**: no condition, no target, no member, no `per` scaler, no
     > unit/religion/rank qualifier, not AI-only, and the flat unit at the scope-wide kind. Anything else has
     > somewhere the grouped line cannot put it, so the test is a property of the ENTRY and lives beside the
     > renderer (`entryIsPlainFlatChannel`), never as a judgement in each composer.
     > ⚠ **The grouped line SPANS FAMILIES, which is why it cannot live inside the per-family walk** — food,
     > production and commerce are three families and one line. It is issued once per block
     > (`appendFlatChannelLine`) and the per-family pass then renders only what is left, so the two passes
     > PARTITION the family rather than both rendering the same deposit.
     > ⚖ This does not soften § A run-on comma-separated line is NOT a block structure: that bans a whole
     > TOOLTIP flattened into prose, not the compact rendering of one homogeneous set inside a block.

     > **⚖ THE DIVISION OF LABOUR — `CvGameTextMgr` KEEPS THE BLOCKS AND LOSES THE SUB-BLOCKS.** The
     > renderer removes *"the vast majority of bespoke work GameTextMgr used to do"*: the text manager
     > *"should only care about TXT_KEY replacements, and be the `Cy` target for actual string content — it
     > should not need to manually convert entries for each individual tooltip, or text box, when that text
     > conversion can be built programmatically."*
     > ⛔ **But the BLOCKS STAY: *"the blocks are different sources put together"*.** A block is a COMPOSITION —
     > one heading over contributions from several distinct sources (building, civic, trait all feeding one
     > happiness block) — so which sources compose it, in what order, under which TXT_KEY heading, is genuinely
     > the text manager's job. ⛔ What must never be hand-built is every SUB-BLOCK — one `appendEntryLines` call
     > per (source, family), and a block simply issues several.
     > ⚑ The test: `getText` around a MAGNITUDE is a hand-built sub-block and wrong; `getText` for a HEADING or
     > choosing which sources belong together is the block, and right.
     >
     > **⛔ A BREAKDOWN ITEMISES WHAT THE OBJECT HAS, AND NOTHING ELSE.** It lists sources DELIVERING a
     > realized value — never a candidate that WOULD deliver one; the two read identically once rendered, so a
     > panel carrying both is unusable, not richer. ⚠ A separator does not rescue it, nor an option defaulting on.
     > ⚑ The discriminator is the ENABLER STATE the line was selected by: a source the object HOLDS belongs in
     > the breakdown; anything off the frontier (`STATE_LISTED`) is a WHAT-IF, for the valuation surface
     > answering *"what do I gain from this?"* — never the account of what a city already has.
     > ⛔ A whole-entity "render every family at once" dump is NOT the shape — it flattens the composition the
     > blocks exist to express, which is why the surface is per-family.
     >
     > **⛔ THE ACCEPTANCE TEST ON A COMPOSER IS *DOES IT STILL READ A LEGACY GETTER*, NEVER *DOES IT READ
     > NICELY*: "we just want to make sure that we don't rely on legacy, and have legacy purged, when
     > creating tooltips."** A composer rendering identically but still reaching a legacy accessor is NOT done;
     > one whose wording changed but whose legacy reads are gone IS
     > ([legacy must fail loud, never mask a cascade gap](../../../specs/validation.md#legacy-must-fail-loud-never-mask-a-cascade-gap)). ⚑ A conversion DELETES rather than ports:
     > each converted band removes its legacy accessor call with it. ⛔ Altered visible text is never a reason
     > to hesitate — say what changed and move on.
     >
     > **⚖ TOOLTIPS ARE NOW THE INSTRUMENT — FEATURE-COMPLETE, AND THEY MUST LOOK RIGHT.** The work is far
     > enough along that tooltips are highly relevant: they must look right and carry ALL the data, because that
     > is how the final missing pieces get found. A tooltip carrying every term of a value is a DECOMPOSITION CENSUS in
     > UI form, reached through the screen instead of the wire — an incomplete tooltip does not merely look
     > sparse, it **hides the gap it exists to reveal**.
     > ⛔ The acceptance test is EVERY FAMILY THE ENTITY CARRIES RENDERS, not the subset a composer happens to
     > have been converted onto. ⚑ MOVEMENT is the named exemplar (especially with things like
     > movement, it's easy to spot when it's wrong) — a player checks it against the unit in front of them, so
     > it is the canary for the rest.
     > ⚠ The composer that renders NOTHING is the one to hunt, and it is silent — an empty tooltip logs no line,
     > fails no build, and reads like an entity with nothing to say. Enumerate composers mechanically rather
     > than trusting a screen looks populated.
     >
     > ⛔ **The retired ruling, recorded because its ABSENCE will look like drift:** tooltips were once
     > explicitly end-stage — *"how tooltips are rendered is fairly irrelevant right now, these are bugs we
     > catch at the end"*. That was an ANTI-RATHOLE GUARD, not a judgement of value: written when *"everything
     > was fucked"* and agents *"consistently and constantly tried to 'keep the game running' despite it not
     > even compiling"*. A red tree renders nothing, so attention spent there was unrecoverable. ⇒ The guard was
     > scoped to a CONDITION that is over — the tree builds, so the work it deferred is now the work.
     > ⚠ What does NOT come back: legacy PARITY — the tooltip SET stays demand-driven, decided from community
     > requests and playtests, so a legacy line a cut removed is
     > not a regression. Completeness is measured against what the ENTITY CARRIES, never what the legacy
     > composer used to print.
     >
     > **⛔ MIMIC HOW TOOLTIPS *LOOKED*; NEVER COMPROMISE HOW THEY ARE *RENDERED*.** The two are separate axes
     > and only one of them is up for imitation. The legacy LOOK is the target — the compact glyph line, the
     > familiar ordering, the density a player already reads at a glance — because that is what makes a tooltip
     > usable and it was got right. The legacy MECHANISM is not: hand-assembled strings, per-composer
     > conversions and legacy getter reads stay cut, whatever the output is supposed to resemble.
     > ⇒ **So "it looked like this before" is a valid argument about APPEARANCE and never a licence to reach for
     > a legacy accessor, re-hand-build a sub-block, or bend the entry renderer around one screen.** When the

     > YIELDS ARE ONE LINE, above, is exactly that: a DENSITY the grammar had not stated, added once, centrally)
     > — never the composer a special case.
     > ⚑ The pairing is what makes both testable: the acceptance test on the MECHANISM is *does it still read a
     > legacy getter*, and the acceptance test on the LOOK is *would a returning player recognise it*.
     >
     > **⚖ THE DEMAND ORDER, MEASURED BY USE — worker · combat · plot · building · unit.** That is the

  **A point getter reads the LOAD-COMPILED sum and nothing else** — compiled once from the anatomy by the one
  compile pass, never runtime-summed, never a second hand-maintained store beside it. And no read anywhere on
  the surface does a per-call string address, map walk, or channel resolution
  ([materialize at mapFrom](../07-materialize-at-mapfrom-no-runtime.md#materialize-at-mapfrom--no-runtime-string-reads-in-info-getters-the-single-source-laws-load-time-sibling)).
- **THE SINGLE-THREAD BUDGET — why this shape is efficient on the one game thread.** The layering is the
  efficiency: (1) repeated hot reads (a BUILT thing's realized value) hit the package caches on the game objects
  ([cascade.md](../../../cascade.md)) — O(1) bare fetches, never an info read; (2) **the anatomy
  walk is LOAD-ONLY** — every runtime ask is a straight fetch of a compiled structure: the point reads over the
  compiled sums, the edge-family lists, the enabler's maintained frontier vectors — **0 calculation on the
  straight asks**; (3) the ONLY thing ever evaluated is the compiled CONDITIONED tail — condition evaluation is
  irreducible (the answer depends on the asking city) and runs at exactly two bounded cadences: event-driven
  package rebuild (EVENT volume), and the per-decision `expected*` read, bounded by **frontier × cities**
  ([enabler.md §6](../../../specs/enabler.md)), never database × cities; (4) every evaluator predicate is an O(1)
  CONTEXT fetch (`plotAttrs` counts, the `policies` union, the operating set) — a predicate that walks
  plots/units per call is the efficiency defect to reject in review. **Consumer call discipline:** `expected*` is
  a per-DECISION read — once per (city, candidate) per pass; an AI needing repeated score access caches its OWN
  scores (the sanctioned AI-heuristic residual, [superseded-ideas #1](../../superseded-ideas.md)) — it never re-asks the
  what-if in an inner loop. A regression in any of this surfaces where every performance regression surfaces — the
  per-turn wall clock ([turn time is king](../../../cascade/16-package-model.md#-the-per-scope-package-model--the-cascades-founding-design-1-stated-as-cache-architecture)).
- **Every AMOUNT getter is ×100 native; a PERCENT is never scaled, and there is no `getX`/`getX100` pair**
  ([the ×100 fixed-point model](../../../specs/curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries) —
  [fixed-point-and-scales.md](../../../specs/curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md) has the full boundary/unit rules and
  the silent-failure tell of a `÷100` landing on a percent slot). The name says the VALUE, never the scale; the
  flat-vs-modifier split lives in the member name (`getFlatYield` vs `getYieldModifier`), never a scale suffix.
- **⚑ A LEGACY `Global*` / `Area*` / `National*` PREFIX IS A SCOPE FRAGMENT — its successor is the SAME kind read
  with a scope ARGUMENT.** This is the single most common disposition in the compiler census, and reading it as a
  missing member instead sends an agent looking for a getter that was never meant to come back:
  `getGlobalYieldModifier` → `getYieldModifier(eYield, CASC_SCOPE_EMPIRE)`, `getCommerceChange` →
  `getFlatCommerce(eCommerce, CASC_SCOPE_CITY)`, `getGlobalFreeSpecialist` / `getAreaFreeSpecialist` →
  `getFreeSpecialistsAny(CASC_SCOPE_EMPIRE)` (area authors at EMPIRE — a landmass is not a scope,
  [cascade.md](../../../cascade.md)). The name lost the fragment because scope became an axis
  ([scope is a separate axis, never folded into the kind](#the-coherent-surface--grouped-storage-parameterized-getters-clarity-and-predictability-is-king)); nothing was removed.
  ⚠ Confirm the KIND enum at the call site rather than pattern-matching the name — the prefix tells you the
  SCOPE, never which kind the value is, and a wrong kind compiles clean and reports a plausible wrong number.
- **Extensible by DATA, not by new members/getters.** A new scalar family is a new `m_scalars` enum entry; a new
  property is a new id in `m_properties`; a new attribute is a new bitset key. The getter surface does not grow.
- Intrinsic self-description (`getAirlift`, `getMaxStartEra`, the shrine/corpHQ FKs, flavours) stays a bare typed
  read — genuine lone values, not a groupable set. The ~300 hand-named getters mirroring the legacy `CvXInfo`
  contract collapse into this surface, and consumers rewire onto it
  ([build a new getter surface, never widen a legacy one](../05-the-two-read-roles-one-grammar-two.md#-the-two-read-roles--one-grammar-two-answers)) — the info half of the access surface.
