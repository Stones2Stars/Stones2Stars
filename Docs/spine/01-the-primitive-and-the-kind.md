# 1. The primitive and the KIND firewall

> Part of the **[spine](../spine.md)** spec.

A caller `emit`s an event; every consumer that registered interest in that event's **KIND** receives it. KIND is
declared **at the call site, never inferred**.

Civ4 multiplayer is deterministic lockstep, so an authoritative count that differs per machine is a desync. KIND
keeps the synced and unsynced streams apart:

| KIND | meaning | synced? | consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`DOMAIN`** | game **state** changed (building built, unit created, tech researched) | yes — deterministic | logging + grants + cache-invalidation + out-of-process replay (NOT the in-engine tally — it reads the object-owned counts) |
| **`SAVELOAD`** | a fact was **read off the save stream** — a log of LOADING, never what sets state | no | **logging only** — never counted, never gates |
| **`DIAGNOSTIC`** | **code** ran (a function entered, a decision re-evaluated) | no — execution trace | **logging only** — never counted, never gates |
| **`TRACE`** | fine-grained "every step" | no | logging only |

Only `DOMAIN` events carry authoritative synced state-changes (for observability, cache-invalidation, and the
out-of-process replay). The in-engine [tally](../specs/tally.md) does **not** consume them — it reads the object-owned
counts directly. The payload is **raw** (typed fields, never a pre-formatted string) so the costly index→text
formatting defers to the gated logging consumer (§8) — when a gate is off, nothing expensive ran.
