# 5. The load reseed

> Part of the **[spine](../spine.md)** spec.

**The load RESEED — the save read goes through the INTERNAL SETTERS.** A loaded save used to deserialize straight
into the `CvCity`/`CvPlot` members, so the setters never fired and the **cascade** (its value packages AND its
enabler side) had nothing to build from. The reseed is fixed **at the read itself**: each slot deserializes into a
LOCAL and is handed to that slot's **internal setter** — the ONE body that commits the member, maintains whatever
derived state the object owns, and announces the fact.

Tech is team-held but emitted per-self from each member's `CvPlayer::read`, one emit per alive member; projects
the same. Beside the DOMAIN facts the setters emit, the read may announce what the STREAM CONTAINED as
`SAVELOAD` lines — a log of loading, consumed by logging alone.

**The load reseed, concretely:** `CvPlayer::read` per held tech / project / civic / trait / heritage + era /
golden-age / state-religion / nukes / commerce sliders; `CvCity::read` per building / religion + holy-city /
corp / specialist / population / power / culture-level; `CvPlot::read` the whole substrate + owner +
working-city — through the INTERNAL SETTERS, so the read announces nothing itself; `CvProperties::readWrapper`
per stored property value on every owner scope — wrapped by the `GAME_LOAD_STARTED` / `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED`
bracket. ⚠ The property block emits from its own read because a property value is DERIVED FROM NOTHING; nothing
else could announce it. A stored 0 is skipped, for the same reason the setter suppresses a no-op (the owner's
`reset()` emptied the bag, so 0 → 0 is not a change); the per-turn CHANGE ledger beside it is deliberately silent,
being an accumulation of deltas the value facts already carry. ⛔ **ONE SERIALIZED SLOT, ONE FACT — there is no
slot a neighbour's fact covers for.** A consumer must never reach back through an object to re-derive a block
from a fact that did not name it — a fact sets ONLY the bit it names ([contexts.md](../cascade.md)),
so a slot nothing announces is a slot nothing knows about.
⚑ **The fix is structural, not a hand-maintained emit list:** the emit lives in the slot's INTERNAL SETTER, so a
newly serialized field cannot be added without going through the one body that announces it.
⚠ **The WORKED set is the CITY's slot, so it reseeds from `CvCity::read`, not from the plot's.** The plot
carries the `IS_WORKED` verdict but only the city can attribute it, so the array's in-read landing is where
the fact comes from — and the cities stream AFTER the map, which is exactly what makes the plot available to
carry the bit and puts the fact before the `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED` fold that reads each plot's FINAL block.

**The reseed grew the matching in-read halves** wherever the setter cannot run on a load: `CvCity::read` (the
disabled-power timer — a save can be taken mid-blackout — and the headquarters designation, tested off the
loaded IDInfo via `CvGame::isHeadquartersByOwnerId`, the `isHolyCityByOwnerId` precedent, because `CvGame`'s
array deserializes before the cities), `CvPlayer::read` (anarchy turns — a save can load mid-revolution — the
golden-age twin), `CvPlot::read` (the plot's city, whose fact no other slot covers — no slot ever covers for
another), `CvTeam::read` (the member count, landed through `changeNumMembers` after `m_eID` deserializes rather
than beside the count, since the id the fact hangs on is only valid from there — and that is the team's WHOLE
reseed, because `EmpireContext` forwards exactly three team facts and the other two, techs and projects, are
announced per-self from `CvPlayer::read`), and **`CvUnit::read`, which previously emitted NOTHING** — the
instance, its promotion set and its combat-class set, each at its own genuine per-element read.
⛔ Three in-read halves are deliberately ABSENT and are not oversights: **the world unit-created counter**
(nothing stores a derivative of it — the cap reads it live, so there is nothing to seed), **the area tile count**
(`SEVT_AREAS_RECALCULATED` is a WHOLESALE fact by construction — it names no source, so every area-id holder
re-reads on it and a per-area announcement would say nothing the wholesale one has not), and **the
fold-announced verdicts** (power / government centre / fresh water — the amenity fold rebuilds from the load's
own facts and announces each verdict crossing itself, so an in-read emit beside it would announce the same
crossing twice). ⛔ Neither is the retired *"another slot's fact covers it"* argument, which is why they are
stated in their own terms: one has no consumer to seed, the other already has a fact. **No slot is ever covered
by a neighbour's.**
⚠ **One endpoint is deliberately unwired: `emitLoadPipeline`** — every one of its arguments is produced by the
archived load-time warm-up/rebuild pass, which the CAPSTONE rule removed
([cascade.md](../cascade.md)); the event reseed replaced that pass, so the
endpoint has no honest caller. Open follow-ups: the tile-driven vicinity backstop, and the per-city enabler
priming that preceded the reseed emits.

⛔ **What the reseed is NOT:** a separate pass that walks already-deserialized objects and **fabricates** events
from their populated state (a "for each building present, emit built"). That pseudo-emit feeds the cascade
reconstructed lies and trains the next agent to reconstruct more — it is banned
([superseded-ideas](../architecture/superseded-ideas.md)). There is no clean middle between it and the real
event-sourced read, so the read-driven reseed is built as its own step, never shimmed.

**The load lifecycle is bracketed by two spine events — `GAME_LOAD_STARTED` / `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED`.** Result-producers
(grants, and any future on-event side-effect machinery) rely **purely on the spine**: they see `LOAD_STARTED` →
suppress, `LOAD_FINISHED` → resume, so nothing is granted during reconstruction (a grant is a RESULT of a genuine
in-play acquisition, and a load is not an acquisition). The **cache-build consumer** is the load-active one — it
consumes the in-read events to build the cascade. New game builds the same way: its real init fires the same
events, with grants active because those are genuine acquisitions. Ledgered as
[the load reseed](#5-the-load-reseed).

> **⛔ `spineGameLoadInProgress()` IS RESULT-PRODUCER SUPPRESSION, AND AGENTS KEEP MISCONSTRUING IT (repeatedly, across sessions).** It answers ONE question: *would acting on this fact HAND SOMETHING OUT for a
> load, which is not an acquisition?* That is why the trigger/grant machinery consults it. ⛔ It is **NOT** a
> licence for a LOAD-ACTIVE consumer to skip work the reseed exists to perform — reaching for it there asserts
> that the load cannot be trusted to build the state, which is precisely the claim
> [the load reseed](#5-the-load-reseed) exists to falsify.
> ⚑ **THE MECHANISM OF THE MISTAKE IS COPYING, not reasoning** — the guard is read off an adjacent case in the
> same `switch` and carried into a new one, so it spreads without anyone deciding it. ⇒ **Never inherit one from
> a neighbouring case. Ask what YOUR handler does**, and answer the test below.
>
> **THE TEST — what does acting on this fact PRODUCE?**
>
> | the handler | verdict |
> |---|---|

> | BUILDS derived state (a context store, an enabler domain, a package) | ⛔ **no guard** — this is the reseed's whole job |
> | needs an object the stream has not delivered yet | ⛔ **not a guard — a BUFFER with a load-end DRAIN.** The two are not the same shape: a guard DROPS the fact, a buffer KEEPS it. Dropping a fact you needed is a permanent hole ([self-heal is not a backstop](../cascade/03-no-staleness-no-selfheal.md#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban)) |
>

> ([contexts.md](../cascade.md)); and reading the bracket as the **new-game-vs-load discriminator**,
> which suppresses nothing at all. ⛔ Do not sweep those out in the name of this rule.
> ⛔ **And a guard must never suppress an EMIT** — that is the separate, absolute ban (§6: emit every distinct
> fact, decide handling per consumer). A consumer that would double-apply on an in-read fact is a CONSUMER
> defect; silencing the fact hides it from every other consumer too.
