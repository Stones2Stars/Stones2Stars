# The cascade — deposits, the maintained sum, and the live-state contexts

The cascade machine that computes **per-turn magnitudes** — a city's food, a unit's strength, a property's
level. Sources **deposit** values; a target reads the **combined total**. It reads the modifier families
authored per the [json spec](specs/json.md) §6; this doc is everything downstream of that authoring: the
deposit flow and combine arithmetic, the conditioning (dormancy) model, the ownership rule that decides *where*
a cross-entity modifier is authored, the **maintained-sum** mechanism that keeps every derived slot correct with
nothing ever marked or recomputed, and the per-scope **contexts** a reader goes to for an entity's live state.

**At heart, a modifier is a [`requires`](specs/enabler.md) gate plus an output.** It uses the *exact same*
condition vocabulary as the enabler — `all`/`any`/`noneOf`, atoms, predicates, scopes — so once `requires` is
nailed the modifier follows for free; the only thing it adds is a **magnitude** to deposit when the gate holds.
So this doc leans on that shared vocabulary (defined in [enabler](specs/enabler.md) / [json](specs/json.md)) and
spends its effort on the **output half**: how a magnitude deposits, accumulates, combines, stays current, and is
read back.

**One owner, one design, stated once.** The deposit machine (formerly `specs/modifier.md`), the maintenance
mechanism that keeps every derived slot correct (formerly `architecture/state-repositories.md`), and the
per-scope live-state read surface (formerly `architecture/contexts.md`) are one concept split across three
files that kept re-establishing the same context for each other. This page is that concept, in one place.

## 1. One step: deposit DOWN, accumulate, read O(1)

Where the [enabler](specs/enabler.md) is two passes, the modifier is **one step**: each source drops its deposit
onto a target, the deposits **accumulate**, and the target reads an **O(1) summed total**. No source needs the
whole picture; order doesn't matter (sums are commutative).

Magnitudes flow **DOWN** the scope spine (`world → … → city → plot | unit`). An empire-scope deposit on a civic
rolls down to each of the player's cities; a city-scope deposit lands locally; a `plots`-target deposit lands on
each matching worked plot (§5). The target reads a combined value — it never re-walks the sources.

This is purely top-down: a condition *inside* a deposit (`enabled`/`per`) is a forward **read** of state, never
an upward cascade-walk. **The reverse view ("who references/modifies me") is derived once at load, never on a
hot path** — realized as reverse edge FAMILIES on the referenced info object itself, populated by the readJson
reverse pass (`EDGEF_RELATED` = the display/pedia candidate lists the tooltips iterate; `EDGEF_REQUIRED_BY` =
the enabler's requires-reverse-index). After load every info ALREADY CARRIES its reverse lookups; no consumer
builds its own scan or side index ([reverse lookups are populated once, at load](#1-one-step-deposit-down-accumulate-read-o1)).

**Three governing rules:** (a) **purely top-down** — sources deposit DOWN, targets read an O(1) accumulator; the
reverse index is cold-path only. (b) **tech-inflation is a downward DEPOSIT, not an upward gate** — a researched
tech deposits down onto everything below it (cheaper/better); the lower thing never reaches UP with a `hasTech`
gate. (c) **info DATA vs engine MACHINERY is a hard boundary** — the JSON carries only values + relationships;
the producers, evaluators, and tally that consume them are engine-side, so authoring stays declarative.

**Every modifiable number is a yield.** ANY number game mechanics modify — base yields, commerce, free XP, free
specialists, property magnitudes, combat percents, heal rates — is a channel in this ONE machine, carried in the
ONE uniform package format (Σflat / Σpercent per channel per scope; the unit is part of the slot key). A number
still computed by a legacy ad-hoc path outside the machine is a shortcut to fold in
([every modifiable number is a yield](#1-one-step-deposit-down-accumulate-read-o1)).

> ⚠ **Two shapes get mistaken for exemptions from that last sentence; neither is one.** A **PARTIAL leg** (a
> pre-improvement / nature-only yield) is still yield compute — it is a SEGMENT of the scope's own package
> (§ THE CONTEXTS, below), never a per-call walk kept outside the machine because it answers a narrower question.
> A **WHAT-IF** (*"what would this improvement yield here"*) is yield compute too: the what-if plane is a READ of

**The output-seam.** Where the engine performs placement/application, the machine owns the two ends and the engine
the middle: (1) authored INPUTS are source-centric deposits (a package); (2) placement/application is engine
infrastructure (free-specialist assignment; the golden-age plot-base-yield-threshold "+1"), not modeled; (3) the
OUTPUT yields flow back as a package, consumed exactly like plot yields. Free specialists (amount + forced type →
deposits; engine places; output yields = package) and golden age (length + grant = JSON inputs; plot-threshold
effect = engine middle; extra plot yield = output package) are the exemplars.

## The maintained sum — a package is never dirtied and recalculated

This is the **design the cascade plane is built to**, stated independently of any one implementation of it. The ONE
uniform package (`Sources/Cascade/CvCascadePackage.h`, channel-indexed Σflat (×100) / Σpercent (unscaled) slots)
is a data member on team / player / city / plot; the per-scope channel sets are minted from the
compiled deposits at load (`CvCascadeChannelRegistry`, the ClassificationRegistry precedent); the package carries
**apply verbs and no other writer**, so the modifier's own spine consumer (`CvModifierConsumer`, load-active)
applies a moved source's deposits directly into the slots they feed; and the combine lives on the calc surface
(`InfoValuation::cityRate` / `groupSumAt`).

### The problem: no unified `dataChanged` trigger

Every derived value in the legacy engine is a **hand-maintained cache with ad-hoc, gappy invalidation**. There is no
single "the source changed, refresh me" primitive, so caches drift out of sync with the data they derive from — one
disease, many instances: a dormant building's improvement-yield never decremented; a building value change leaving
the cache on the old value; transition-only stamps (`doVicinityBonus`) missing build-after-connect orders; two
surfaces reporting different worked-plot yields for the same city at the same moment. The legacy incremental
serialized accumulators additionally carry **history pollution** — values no live data source can produce (the
improvement-yield accumulators hold phantom yields, per-plot, bit-exact; the wellbeing accumulators the same class —
§2b). Recompute-from-source is the cure; recompute-every-read getters (the squirrelBanana class) were the
workaround for a cache nobody could trust — correct, but paying full cost on the hot path.

### The model

> **the state changes → the fact is emitted → the fact's own source updates the slot it feeds → every consumer
> reads that one value as a bare fetch.** One announcement, one application, one source of truth.

A derived cache in this model is:

1. **EVENT-MAINTAINED, not mark-driven.** The DOMAIN fact names the SOURCE; the compiled index names that
   source's deposits; applying them IS the maintenance. A READ is a **bare fetch** and never recomputes
   (an ensure-on-read protocol is tombstoned), and there is no staleness flag on the unconditioned plane to gate
   anything on. **The work is proportional to what CHANGED (one source's handful of deposits), never to what
   EXISTS (every source at the scope).**
2. **Recompute-only, NOT serialized** — the [derived data is never trusted from a save](specs/save.md#5-derived-data-serializes-nothing-) rule,
   applied per-field. Neither the value nor the flag is saved; on load the flag is marked by default, so the first read
   recomputes from current state — **never stale-from-save**. Drop serialization by the **soft-remove**
   ([the soft-remove save discipline](specs/save.md#3-removing-a-serialized-field--the-soft-remove-via-assetssavemigrationtxt-), [save.md §3](specs/save.md)): FULL-DELETE the
   read + write and NAME the tag in `Assets/savemigration.txt`, which drains an old save's orphan bytes by name so
   nothing after it shifts (a no-op on a new save that never wrote it). **No `WRAPPER_SKIP_ELEMENT`** (it leaves the
   dead member named — a rollerskate target); and just deleting the read/write *without* the `savemigration.txt` entry
   desyncs the whole downstream read.
   **This is UNIVERSAL, not per-field-optional (owner ruling): NO cache is ever serialized** — so nothing derived
   is ever read from a save, and there is correspondingly nothing for a blanket recompute to purge.
   ⛔ **No blanket recompute of derived state exists anywhere in the engine, and none is ever to be built**
   ([self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban)): the event spine builds the state, LOAD is the only
   full pass (§ THE CAPSTONE RULE, below), and a missed invalidation must stay visible instead of being swept away. ⛔ A
   wipe-the-totals-and-reapply pass over live game objects is therefore never a maintenance path to add or extend
   — *"it is inherently obsolete under the event-driven system, since the new system recalcs on load anyway"*
   (owner). It is the exact shape this model replaces, and it is worst where it looks most useful: firing on the
   saves most likely to have drifted is what would hide the missed emits the spine exists to expose. Each
   remaining serialized cache converts by the same move: skip the read, rebuild at load from source state through
   the live entry points (the bonus-network cluster — the plot-group counts AND membership, the bonus-fed
   wellbeing/modifier accumulators, power, the dormancy verdicts — is the realized exemplar: the load-end rebuild
   in `CvGame::onFinalInitialized` recolors the groups from current state, folds the counts as each plot joins,
   and reconciles dormancy to the enabler's operate fixpoint, firing the ordinary crossing emits; the city holds
   no bonus mirror at all — its read is a plot-group relay, [enabler.md §8](specs/enabler.md)). A serialized
   store survives ONLY for genuine non-derivable state (the event/WB grant stores, e.g.
   `CvCity::m_paiFreeBonusEvents`).
3. **The single source — PULL, not push, and the rule is CROSS-SCOPE.** ⛔ **What is banned is a scope pushing
   its total into ANOTHER scope's store**: an upper scope's package never lands in a lower one, and a receiver
   total is the Σ of its MEMBERS' realized values read at the receiver, never deltas the members push upward.
   That is where "push + a parallel cache double-count and drift" actually bites — two stores holding one fact,
   one of them maintained by someone else.
   ⚑ **A deposit landing in its OWN scope's slot is NOT that, and reading it as that is the misreading this
   clause exists to prevent.** By the scope principle (§1) a city-scope deposit BELONGS at city scope; the
   package is the only thing holding it, so there is no parallel cache to diverge from and nothing to
   double-count. Applying the fact to the slot the fact feeds is the maintenance, not a push.

**Worked shape (the plot-yield cache):** `getYield()` = `return cached` — a bare fetch, always O(1), because the
fact that moved the plot already applied its deposits into the slot;
**⚖ A CROSS-SCOPE RECEIVER TOTAL IS RE-SUMMED AT READ, AND NO SLOT HOLDS IT (owner).** *"I believe it will cost
more to cache such a number in most cases than it would to just do the sum of all cities."* Each channel has ONE
consuming scope (production → city; the commerces further up), and where that scope is ABOVE its members the
total is the Σ of their realized values, taken at the read — there is no `sum` slot, no `readSum`, and no
`applySum`, and none is to be built.
⚑ **The arithmetic is why, not thrift:** a member's realized value is the §2a combine, which is NOT linear in the
deposits, so a cached total could not be moved by a deposit delta at all — it would have to be re-derived on
every fact that touches any member, which is strictly more work than summing the members when someone asks.
⚖ **THE THRESHOLD, so this is re-derivable rather than remembered (owner): *"I do not think for a million years
it would ever be worth caching a value that loops X cities for 1 number and sums it, unless the number of cities
is in the thousands."*** An empire holds tens of cities, so the Σ is tens of adds over values each member already
holds. ⛔ That bar is nowhere near met, and it applies to a HAND-ROLLED bank of the same number just as much as
to a package slot — caching it anywhere is the move being refused, not merely caching it in the cascade.
⚑ **And the VOLATILITY settles it independently of the count (owner): *"especially a number like a commerce
yield, that pretty much constantly fluctuates."*** A cache pays off in proportion to how long an entry stays
valid; a commerce yield moves on nearly every fact in the economy, so a stored total would be re-derived about
as often as it is read and would spend the rest of its life WRONG. ⇒ The two tests compose: cache-worthiness
needs both a large member count and a stable value, and a receiver total has neither. ⚠ A staler variant — a
once-per-turn snapshot of the same Σ — is the worse answer, not the safer one: it trades the cost for a value
that is knowingly out of date on a number that never stops moving.
⛔ So the cost of a receiver read is the MEMBER COUNT, and that is accepted. What is NOT accepted is asking it
per candidate in a scoring loop ([patterns.md](architecture/patterns.md) § THE VALUATION PROTOCOL: a how-valuable
weight is asked at most once per turn) — the cadence is the defect, never the Σ.

⛔ **What is banned is a HAND-NAMED field holding that same number** — a `CvCity::m_plotYieldSum`-shaped member is
the defect [every derived cache is one shape](#-every-derived-store-is-one-shape--a-keyed-accumulator-maintained-by-a-delta-owner) names (it cannot be addressed by the
derived mask, so it forces a bespoke invalidation path) and a second maintenance surface for a fact the modifier
consumer already routes. ⛔ Equally banned is the other direction: re-summing per read. **Cache it — in the slot
that already exists.** The push-maintained `m_aiBaseYieldRate` is dead, and a legacy tier-1 accessor over it
(`getPlotYield`) is a DELETION, not a value to re-home: its consumers read the channel at its receiving scope
([build a new getter surface, never widen a legacy one](architecture/patterns.md#-the-two-read-roles--one-grammar-two-answers-owner)). ⛔ The pull must be a CACHE at EVERY level, never a per-read walk: re-summing the radius on every
`getPlotYield` call turns the game's hottest read O(radius) — measured at 913M plot reads in one turn inside the
governor's valuation, the cost class this whole doc exists to prevent. The engine's actual base yield thereby equals the build-order-independent value the cascade computes —
stale-cache divergences resolved **at the source**, behaviour-preserving
([the completeness+attribution bar](specs/validation.md#the-observation-surface)).

### ⛔ A STALENESS FLAG IS THE FOSSIL OF AN INCOMPLETE EMIT SURFACE — the same rule, one level up

> ([leave no evidence of the abandoned path](../AGENTS.md#design)), and this one names a CLAIM the
> engine can no longer make.
>
> **⛔ AND NEITHER DO WE CALL A READ "HOT" (owner) — A PACKAGE READ IS JUST A READ.** *"They are not a hottest
> read, they are just a read."* A read can only be HOT if reading does WORK, so the word asserts there is
> something to recalculate — it smuggles the recompute model back in over code that has none, exactly as "dirty"

> ⚠ **The tell is a justification, not a slur:** the moment a slot is defended on the grounds that it keeps some
> read cheap, the reasoning has left the model — a slot exists because a FACT applies a delta into it, and that
> is the whole of the argument for it. Performance framing around a package read is how "cache it" comes back.

> **⚖ THE PROTOCOL IS SUPERSEDED, NOT A ROLLERSKATE — full archaeology in [superseded-ideas #30](architecture/superseded-ideas.md)
> (contrast #14, the ensure-on-read protocol, which genuinely was one).** *"I did not recognize that marking became
> obsolete the moment we landed on eventspine for everything"* (owner): it was correctly designed and faithfully
> built for a world with no unified eventing, and the premise dissolved SILENTLY the moment the spine went
> universal — it kept producing correct numbers at unnecessary cost, with no error or symptom to chase.

**A staleness flag is a CLAIM THAT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT CHANGED.** Once every mutation announces itself, the FACT
is strictly more informative than the memo — it names the SOURCE, and the compiled index names that source's
deposits — so the flag becomes a lossy summary of an answer already in hand.

⇒ **The mechanical test, and it applies to the whole engine, not just this plane: every staleness bit, staleness
stamp, epoch counter and version number is asserting that what changed is unknowable. Under a complete spine that
assertion is FALSE BY CONSTRUCTION.** So each surviving one is exactly two things and never a third: a **missing
emit wearing a flag** (wire the fact — [an event gap is closed the moment it is found](spine.md#-a-fact-names-the-happening--something-changed-is-not-a-fact-owner)), or
**dead weight** (delete it). ⛔ It is never a mechanism to keep because it works.

### ⛔ A SELF-HEAL IS THE FOSSIL OF A MISSING EMIT — so it is a SEARCH, not just a ban

**Where self-heal came from (owner):** the old branch was full of blanket recalculations *because agents did not
properly wire the events and shortcut by adding a self-heal calc instead*. That is the causal direction, and it is
what makes [self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban) findable rather than merely prohibitive:

> **A recalc does not appear because someone wanted a recalc. It appears because a fact was not announced, the
> value went wrong, and recomputing was the cheapest way to make the symptom stop.**

⇒ **Every self-heal marks the spot where an emit is missing.** So when you find one — a periodic rebuild, a
"refresh if stale", a runaway cap that "recovers next slice", a wipe-and-reapply — do NOT simply delete it and
declare the rule enforced. **Find the fact it was compensating for and wire THAT**; the recalc then has nothing
left to do and is removed as a consequence, not as the fix.

⚠ And a self-heal is worse than the bug it hides, which is why it is banned rather than tolerated: the missed emit
would have surfaced as a visibly wrong value that someone could chase, whereas the recalc converts it into
permanent invisible drift **and** reinstates exactly the per-read/per-turn work the caches exist to delete.
⛔ A comment claiming a recalc "heals" something is itself suspect twice over — the healer may not even exist any
more (a slice rebuild that was since removed), leaving a truncation that repairs nothing and announces nothing.

### ⛔ THE LEGACY-ACCUMULATOR CUT — every accumulator, ONE uniform mechanism

> Binding: [the uniform legacy-accumulator cut](#-the-legacy-accumulator-cut--every-accumulator-one-uniform-mechanism). **NOT wellbeing-specific — it is
> EVERY legacy serialized incremental accumulator, and they all work exactly the same way.** Wellbeing was the pilot
> that proved it; the same cut then repeats UNCHANGED. **Blast radius is not a concern — it is the SIGNAL: a cut
> that does NOT reach broadly means the legacy is not actually being cut.**

**What an accumulator IS — the three-part test.** A member that is ALL of: (1) **serialized** in `read()`/`write()`;
(2) **incrementally maintained** by `change*`/`update*`/`process*` deltas, never recomputed-from-source; (3) a
**per-turn game quantity the cascade now owns**. These are the STORED-ACCUMULATOR DRIFT class
(§2b): they carry decades of save history no live source can reproduce, so a
stored-vs-recompute diff is **DRIFT (history pollution), never state to preserve** — the recompute is the correct side.

**⚑ HOW TO FIND THEM — a MECHANICAL detector, not a reading exercise.** The three-part test above says what an
accumulator IS; this says how to enumerate the ones that have already gone dead, and it needs no judgement:

> **a mutator with NO remaining call site + a member that is still SERIALIZED + a getter that is still READ
> = a consumer being served a FROZEN SAVE VALUE.**

Each leg is a grep. The mutator has no caller because the cascade replaced whatever used to call it (a
`processBuilding` / `processTech` feeder that now deposits instead); the member still deserializes, so the value is
whatever history the save carries; and the getter still has consumers, so that history is what they read. On a NEW
game the same member is simply frozen at zero — the two failure modes look completely different and are one defect.

⚠ **It is invisible from every direction that normally catches things.** It compiles (the getter exists), it runs
(the value is plausible), the compiler census says nothing (no symbol was deleted), and the decomposition
censuses cannot see it (the value is not in a package at all). ⛔ So it is not found by reading code around a bug — it is
found by running the detector over the whole class.

> **⛔ RUN THE THIRD LEG AGAINST THE MEMBER, NEVER ONLY AGAINST THE GETTER — a reader is often named for the
> ANSWER it computes rather than for the member it reads.** The leg asks whether the value is still consumed,

⚑ **THE DATA SIDE OF THE SAME DEFECT IS THE `unkinded-member` CENSUS**, and the two should be read together: a
family member the parser cannot kind is an authored deposit dropped at load, and the dead accumulator beside it is
the legacy carrier that used to hold that very value. Where they pair, the quantity is missing END TO END — the
data lands nowhere, the carrier is fed by nothing, and the consumers read save history. *(The worked pair: the
authored `hurry.cost` deposits are dropped as unkinded, `CvPlayer::m_iHurryCostModifier` has no writer left, and its
consumers read it regardless.)*

**The uniform mechanism:**

1. Add the cluster's **fresh-gather accessor** returning its term from the cascade, ×100 internally.
2. **Re-point the realized getter** to it, reducing `÷100` at the reader boundary — **no `*Legacy` fallback, no
   variant getter** ([legacy must fail loud, never mask a cascade gap](specs/validation.md#legacy-must-fail-loud-never-mask-a-cascade-gap): anything sneaking a legacy value
   back in is an ERROR, never a safety net; on a red tree a wrong/empty cascade value is the CORRECT exposed outcome).
3. **HARD-DELETE** the member and its maintainers.
4. **FULL-DELETE the read + write** and NAME the tag in `Assets/savemigration.txt` — the reader drains the orphan
   transparently ([save.md §3](specs/save.md)). No `WRAPPER_SKIP_ELEMENT`; an UNLISTED deleted-read orphan is the
   one hard desync.
5. **The COMPILER is the census** — every surviving consumer is a compile error to rewire; you cannot
   flip-and-pretend. Done = endpoint-observable on a loaded save, not "it compiles."

⚠ **Audit each deleted `change*`/`update*` BODY for side effects first** — legacy changers carry non-obvious riders
(trade-network recompute, UI-dirty, power) the surviving trigger site must still fire ([save.md §6](specs/save.md)).

**Incremental-accumulate ledgers convert to recompute-from-source.** A serialized player ledger that replays its
accumulator onto the loaded value double-counts by build order. The conversion is the uniform one above: recompute
from the player's own held sources on the mark, make the changer trigger-only, and have the cities PULL it.

**Event/vote grants are NOT cached — they are a SEPARATELY PERSISTED store.** A per-building commerce change has
two sources of fundamentally different nature: the **empire** grant (`GlobalBuildingExtraCommerces`, civics) is
DERIVABLE → the recompute-from-source cache; the **event/vote** grant (fires ONCE) is **genuine one-shot state, NOT
derivable** — *"having events just be stored in the cache is lunacy"* (a recompute cache would wipe them). They live
in their own serialized field (`CvCity::m_aBuildingCommerceChangeEvents`), outside the recompute path; the reader
sums `player-recompute (empire) + city event/vote (persisted)`.

### ⛔ THE READ IS A BARE FETCH — AND WHAT ONCE STOOD BESIDE IT IS DEAD (owner)

The recompute-and-diff endpoint pair, the read-side `ensure()` protocol, and treating a divergence as an in-DLL
HAPPENING are all retired — see [validation.md](specs/validation.md) for the live THREE-LEG check (the LOGS,
the JSON INFO, and WHAT STATE EXPECTS, all three agreeing) and [superseded-ideas](architecture/superseded-ideas.md) #14/#19/#33
for why each died. **"The ensures were some of the earliest rollerskates"** — measured: an ensure-per-read
protocol on AI-hot paths ground unit automation. What this section adds, because it binds specifically here:

**A read is a BARE FETCH, unconditionally** — there is no gate test on it, because there is nothing on the read
path to gate.

⛔ **NEVER emit a divergence as a spine event — that is a GUARANTEED LICENSE TO BUILD SELF-HEALING (owner).** An
event is an **invitation to a consumer**. Put a divergence on the spine and the next agent writes the consumer
that "handles" a value known to be wrong by CORRECTING it — self-heal then arrives wearing the authority of the
event spine ([self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban)). **A PULL (something a reader asks for) cannot
grow that consumer; a PUSH (an event fanned to whoever registers) grows it by default.** So there is no diff, no
log line, no event and no field for one.

⚠ **And anything that RECOMPUTES in order to check must not be able to write back what it computed** — a
verifier that repairs is self-heal wearing a different hat. That is a property to get from the STRUCTURE (compute
into scratch the caller owns) rather than from a discipline anyone has to remember.

**The identity a divergence needs to be actionable:** "some city's production flats are wrong" across 185 cities
identifies nothing, so every served value carries its owner, **interpreted per scope** as the spine's DOMAIN ints
are interpreted per event: city = `(owner, cityId)` · empire = `(playerId, —)` · team = `(—, teamId)` ·
plot = `(x, y)` (a plot has no owner-independent id, and the map index needs a map that does
not exist at bind). Identity is passed IN at bind — the scope owners share no common id accessor.

⚠ **Consequence, and it is not optional: the STORED side is built by APPLIES ONLY.** The fact that names a source
applies that source's deposits — the same shape the contexts use — and there is no rebuild anywhere for a sweep to
batch (§ THE MAINTAINED SUM).

### ⛔ THE AI PLANE IS NOT EXEMPT — AN AI CACHE IS INVALIDATED BY SPINE FACTS, LIKE ANYTHING ELSE (owner)

> *"AI loops should not run the full run all the time, and if we cache the AI data, they should be invalidated
> by the relevant spineEvents like anything else."*

Two halves, and the second is the one that is easy to get wrong. **An AI loop re-running its full pass every
time is the defect** — the same O(what EXISTS) shape the maintained sum deletes everywhere else. **And the
cache that fixes it is an ordinary spine CONSUMER**: it declares the facts that move it and applies them, in
exactly the shape [a context dictionary is a spine consumer](#what-a-context-stores-vs-forwards---a-context-is-an-event-built-store-not-a-forwarding-facade-owner) specifies for every other
store.

⛔ **So a hand-set staleness flag on an AI cache is NOT the sanctioned residual.** The residual
([superseded-ideas](architecture/superseded-ideas.md) #1) is that the AI may keep its OWN SCORES — it is about WHAT is
cached, never about being excused from HOW every derived store is maintained. A `mark*Stale()` the AI calls
itself is [a staleness flag is the fossil of a missing emit](#-a-staleness-flag-is-the-fossil-of-an-incomplete-emit-surface--the-same-rule-one-level-up) on the AI plane: it asserts we cannot know what
changed, which a saturated emit surface falsifies, and it drifts the moment a new fact moves the value and
nobody remembers to call it.
⇒ **The disposition is the usual one and needs no new mechanism:** name the facts that genuinely move the
score, register for them, and the flag has nothing left to do.

⚑ **AND IT REUSES THE STORE, NOT JUST THE DISCIPLINE (owner): *"there is nothing at all stopping us from
using ContextDict, or something similar, for the AI data, and have them invalidate on the spine events they
care about."*** The AI plane is a tenant of the SAME replacement as everything else
([ContextDict replaces CvDerivedCache](#-cvderivedcache-is-replaced-by-contextdict--virtually-everywhere-owner)) -- a keyed store
fed by the facts it declares -- so an AI cache needs no bespoke machinery and gets none.

⚠ **"Or something similar" is the load-bearing half, and collapsing it to "use ContextDict" would be the
conflation this document already warns about** (§ THEY BEHAVE SIMILARLY AND ARE NOT THE SAME, below): what varies
is what the slot HOLDS. `ContextDict` is a REFCOUNT -- `add(id, ±1)`, read `has()`, and **deliberately no `set`**,
because a `set` overwrites a refcount. An AI SCORE is not a refcount: it is REPLACED wholesale when its inputs
move, so it wants a sibling with assignment, not the refcount type with a `set` bolted on.
⇒ **What is shared is the MAINTENANCE RULE and the key space, never the value semantics** -- which is exactly
[every derived store is a keyed accumulator](#-every-derived-store-is-one-shape--a-keyed-accumulator-maintained-by-a-delta-owner)'s own statement that the possession and magnitude
planes are one structure differing in key space and value type. ⛔ Do NOT add `set` to `ContextDict` to make an
AI score fit it.

⚠ **This does not license caching EARLY.** [legacy decache poisons perf measurement](#-legacy-decache-poisons-perf-measurement--and-converts-an-ai-loop-into-a-hang-owner)
sequences it: run uncached, let the hot paths announce themselves, fix the READS that should never have
computed, and only THEN let the AI plane cache its own scores. This rules how that cache is maintained when it
lands, not when it lands.

⚖ **AND UNTIL IT LANDS, THE EXISTING AI VALUATION MEMOS SELF-HEAL — ruled (owner): *"AI valuation should self
heal for now, it is not part of cascade."*** The turn-scoped memo clears (tech values, mission targets, civic
values, build values, unit counts, trade routes, resource consumption) are the sanctioned interim: an AI
VALUATION is a heuristic the asking side owns, not cascade/derived game state, so
[self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban) does not reach it at this stage. ⛔ Do not strip the memo
clears meanwhile, and do not convert one onto fact-driven invalidation ahead of the sequencing above — this
section rules the shape the AI cache takes WHEN the plane converts, never that it converts now.

### ⛔ LEGACY DECACHE POISONS PERF MEASUREMENT — AND CONVERTS AN AI LOOP INTO A HANG (owner)

**Home of [legacy decache poisons perf measurement](#-legacy-decache-poisons-perf-measurement--and-converts-an-ai-loop-into-a-hang-owner).**

The #430 cut NUKED the serialized accumulators legacy calcs depended on for O(1) reads (`m_iBuildingGoodHappiness`
and its cluster, …). Stripped of those caches, a surviving legacy calc (`happyLevelLegacy`, `badHealthLegacy`, …)
recomputes from scratch on EVERY call — so ANY perf measurement taken while legacy still runs in a read path
measures **legacy's decache penalty, not the cascade** (proven: the unit-selection lag was legacy
`unhappyLevel(iExtra)`/`badHealth(bNoAngry)` what-if re-sums per read; it vanished the instant the getters went
cascade-only). All turn-time/FPS/lag numbers gathered with legacy on any hot read path are POISONED. Clean perf
is only measurable AFTER legacy is fully purged — so the violent purge is a PREREQUISITE for the perf hunt, not
merely a correctness/tidiness step. Sharpens [turn time is king](#-the-per-scope-package-model--the-cascades-founding-design-1-stated-as-cache-architecture).

⛔ **AND IT DOES NOT ONLY POISON MEASUREMENT — IT CONVERTS AN AI LOOP INTO A HANG (owner): the AI loops "looping
all the things when they don't need to" are a SYMPTOM, and they surface now "because we do not serialize their
caches anymore."** The loops were always shaped this way; every inner read used to hit a serialized accumulator
and cost O(1), so the shape was merely wasteful. Strip the accumulators and each read RECOMPUTES, so an
`O(candidates × cities)` loop becomes `O(candidates × cities × cities)` and stalls outright.

⇒ **Both halves are the fix, and neither alone is:** the READ must be an O(1) maintained slot again
([the maintained sum](#-the-maintained-sum--three-planes-one-slot-and-nothing-is-ever-recomputed)), AND the caller must stop asking a scope-wide question per
candidate. ⚑ **Expect MANY** — three surfaced in one session from one root (`AI_isFinancialTrouble` re-walking
every city, `readFlat` doing a tree lookup, `cityReceiverRate` re-walking the plot ring), each found only by
attaching a debugger to a spinning process, because a spin EMITS NOTHING and every log goes silent at once.
⚠ So a hang with a saturated core and dead logs is this class until proven otherwise — and the CPU reading is
per-core, so one pinned core reads as ~0% in Task Manager on a many-core box.

⚖ **AND THE UNCACHED STATE IS AN INSTRUMENT, NOT ONLY A COST (owner): *"it is useful to run through like this
without caching to see where the hottest path is."*** This is the half that inverts the entry above. Behind a
serialized accumulator an `O(n³)` loop is INVISIBLE — it merely costs a slice of every turn forever, and nothing
ever points at it. Strip the accumulator and the same shape becomes a HANG, which is locatable in minutes with a
debugger attach. The decache did not create these; it made them findable.

⇒ **Consequence for sequencing, and it is the actionable half: do NOT hurry caching back in.** Every cache
restored re-blinds the surface it covers, so the order is (1) run uncached, (2) let the hot paths announce
themselves as stalls, (3) fix the READS that should never have computed, (4) only then let the AI plane cache its
own scores, simply ([ai-architecture-north-star.md](plans/parked/ai-architecture-north-star.md)). A cache
added while a wrong-shaped read is still underneath it hides the read instead of fixing it — the
[self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban) failure one plane over.

## ⚖ EVERY DERIVED STORE IS ONE SHAPE — a KEYED ACCUMULATOR maintained by a delta (owner)

**A count is a sum.** The possession plane and the magnitude plane are not two mechanisms — they are one
structure over different payloads, and the only things that vary are the key space and the value type:

| store | key → value | the delta arrives from |
|---|---|---|
| the plot group's bonuses | `id → count` | a member plot/city joining or leaving |
| `CityContext.amenities` | `id → count` | a grantor starting or stopping conferring |
| `CityContext`'s vicinity tiers (all/owned/foreign/worked/onSite) | `id → count` | a radius plot's bonus, ownership or served-resource verdict moving |
| `EmpireContext.policies` | `id → count` | a civic / trait / project / wonder |
| the enabler's membership planes | `id → (enable, remove)` | a HAVE-change |
| `OperatingBuildings::providedCount` | `id → count` | an active flip |
| **the cascade packages** | `channel → Σvalue` | a source's compiled deposits |

⇒ **`ContextDict` and `CvCascadePackage` share a MAINTENANCE RULE**, so
[the maintained sum](#-the-maintained-sum--three-planes-one-slot-and-nothing-is-ever-recomputed) is the MAGNITUDE case of one general rule, never a
cascade-only one.

> **⛔ THEY BEHAVE SIMILARLY AND ARE NOT THE SAME — sharing a mechanism is not sharing an identity (owner).**

cache on the cascade plane"* was drawn too narrowly: the plane boundary is not real, and the one store that
drifted onto a different mechanism is the one that boundary excluded.

### ⛔ THE SEMIBOOLEAN STATE — the read is BOOLEAN, the storage is NOT (owner)

**That mismatch IS the trap: storing the thing as what it READS like is the whole error.** The contract:

- **STORED** `id → count`, an int.
- **READ** `has(id)` ≡ `count > 0`.
- **WRITTEN** ±1 as a grantor starts or stops participating — never `set`, never `clear`, never a recount.
- **ZEROED at owner reset** — a delta store is correct only from a known zero, and `CvCity` is recycled out of an
  `FFreeListTrashArray`, so a reused slot inherits the previous occupant's counts and **no later delta can ever
  correct them** (§ THE CONTEXTS, below).

⛔ **THE READ SURFACE IS A BOOLEAN GETTER, AND CONSUMERS NEVER SEE THE INT (owner).** *"The dictionary literally
needs to have a boolean getter that says whether it's there."* `has(id)` ≡ `count > 0` IS the contract; the count
exists so MAINTENANCE can be correct, not so a reader can inspect it. ⚠ The moment a consumer reads the number
the representation leaks — `count == 1` / `count > 2` logic appears, and then **volumetric can never land**,
because changing what the number MEANS breaks readers that were never meant to see it. The one legitimate reader
of the int is the genuinely volumetric one.
⇒ **The surface: `has(id)` → bool for every consumer · `add(id, ±1)` for maintenance · `count(id)` reserved for
a volumetric reader · and NO `set`.**
⛔ **`set(id, n)` IS THE FOOTGUN AND DOES NOT BELONG ON THIS TYPE** — it overwrites a refcount, so a key that
several grantors confer is cleared by the first one to leave. The live case is the THIRD RING
(`CLS_AMENITY_ADDS_3RD_RING`, read through `CvCity::hasThirdRing`): several buildings confer it, so an assignment
would shrink a city's workable radius the moment it lost ONE of TWO grantors, where the refcount keeps the ring.
A type that PERMITS the banned move forces the rule to be remembered; removing the verb makes it
unsayable, which is the enforcement model this project keeps choosing
([patterns.md](architecture/patterns.md): a contract, not a prohibition).

⛔ **ALWAYS A COUNT, NEVER A BIT — and the deciding argument is not "some keys have several grantors."** It is
that **you can never safely answer NO**: these registries are OPEN by design
([the classification-infos registry](specs/json.md#8-classification--unit-skillstagsstate-building-attributes--empire-capabilities)), so a key with one grantor today gains a
second the moment someone AUTHORS data, with no engine change. A bitset breaks silently on a data edit, in a
build nobody touched. The count is not a concession to the multi-grantor cases; it is the only representation
that survives an open registry.
⚑ Two properties fall out free, and both are already ruled for the amenity instance: **VOLUMETRIC needs no
reshape** (the slot is already an int, so a state that becomes a QUANTITY only changes what the number means),
and the **REMOVAL-WINS trap is structurally absent**.
⚠ **The masking to recognise:** a set-shaped store survives only while something RECOMPUTES it whole. Convert
such a store to delta maintenance without converting its STORAGE and it breaks immediately — so the two halves
land together or not at all.

## ⚖ THE MAINTAINED SUM — THREE PLANES, ONE SLOT, AND NOTHING IS EVER RECOMPUTED

Every slot is one identity, and reading it settles the whole maintenance question:

> **`slot` = Σ over the scope's LIVE sources `S`, over `S`'s compiled deposits `d`, of
> `value(d) × multiplier(S) × perScale(d) × [condition(d) holds]`**

**All four operands are ALREADY MAINTAINED BY AN EVENT.** `value(d)` is compiled at load (the deposit index);
`multiplier(S)` and `perScale(d)` are COUNTS the game objects and the context dictionaries (§ THE CONTEXTS,
below) hold; the condition verdict reads the contexts' own stored predicate state. Nothing on the right-hand side
arrives unannounced, so there is nothing left for a recompute to discover —
[a staleness flag is the fossil of a missing emit](#-a-staleness-flag-is-the-fossil-of-an-incomplete-emit-surface--the-same-rule-one-level-up)'s test applied to the VALUE plane rather than
to a flag.

The compiled data splits every deposit by WHICH OPERAND VARIES, and the split decides its **ROUTE, never its
storage**. ⛔ All three planes apply into the SAME slot: there is no per-plane segment and no per-source
decomposition (§ THE CROSS-SCOPE RECEIVER, below, bans one, and this shape needs none — that it adds no storage
at all is the tell that the cut is drawn in the right place).

| plane | the deposit | the fact that moves it | the delta applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — CONSTANT** | null-condition, unscaled | the SOURCE arriving or leaving | `±value` |
| **B — SCALED** | `value × count(key)` — a `per` scaler, a `plots`-target, a keyed count | the source, **and the COUNT** | source: `±value × count` · **count: `±value × Δcount`** |
| **C — CONDITIONED** | gated on a predicate | the source, **and the ATOM's verdict crossing** | `±value`, over the deposits that atom gates |

⚑ **PLANE B IS WHAT THE DICTIONARIES BUY, AND IT IS WHY A COUNT FACT EXISTS AT ALL (owner).** `Δ(v × c) = v × Δc`
is EXACT — `v` is a compiled constant and `Δc` is what the fact carries — so a `ContextDict::add(id, ±1)` IS a
yield delta of `Σ(deposits keyed on id) × ±1`. *"+1 food per river tile"* stops being a re-derivation and becomes
one multiply the moment a river bit moves. **This is the reason a population-changed fact is emitted** (owner):
a `per: {POPULATION}` scaler is plane B, and the fact carries the delta that resolves it.

### ⛔ THE INVARIANT — the slot is correct at every instant, which is what makes plane C delta-able

> **At every instant `slot == Σ resolve(d, state_now)`, because every operand's move applies its own delta at the
> moment it moves.**

It is inductive, and it holds only if EVERY operand has a route — which is exactly what a saturated emit surface
buys. Four consequences:

- **A WITHDRAWAL IS ALWAYS EXACT.** `emit()` dispatches SYNCHRONOUSLY ([spine.md](spine.md)),
  so no two operands are ever in flight together: when a fact arrives, every other operand still holds the value
  the stored contribution was computed against.
- **⚖ THE CONDITIONED TAIL IS THEREFORE DELTA'D TOO, PER ATOM (owner) — it is NOT re-resolved.** The earlier
  ruling that plane C could only re-resolve rested on *"`perScale` at deposit time is gone"*, and that is true
  only where a count can move WITHOUT announcing. Under plane B it always announces, so the state is never gone.
  ⛔ **B AND C ARE COUPLED — deliver both, or neither.** Delta-ing C while a count can still move unrouted
  reproduces precisely the drift the earlier ruling guarded against: the slot loses an amount it was never told
  about, and nothing re-derives it ([self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban)).
- **ORDER-INDEPENDENCE SURVIVES, which is why LOAD is not a special case.** Source-then-count and
  count-then-source converge: the source applies `value × count_now` (0 if the count has not arrived yet), and
  the count applies `value × Δcount` for every deposit whose source is already live. A count route therefore
  tests the source's liveness at that owner — an O(1) `has()` — and applies for nobody else.
- ⚠ **THE HAZARD IS DOUBLE APPLICATION, NOT DRIFT.** One fact drives exactly ONE route class. Where a happening
  moves both a source and a count they are two distinct FACTS
  ([a fact names the happening](spine.md#-a-fact-names-the-happening--something-changed-is-not-a-fact-owner)), each applying its own — never one fact
  applying both.

- **⛔ NO PLANE HAS AN EVALUATION MOMENT TO DEFER, WHICH IS WHY NONE OF THEM CARRIES A STALENESS FLAG.** There is
  nothing to be stale ABOUT: every operand is compiled or maintained, so a slot is either current or was never
  told — and "never told" is a MISSING EMIT that must stay visible, not a state to schedule work against.
- **⚖ THE COMPLEXITY SHIFTS FROM O(WHAT EXISTS) TO O(WHAT CHANGED), AND THAT IS THE PERFORMANCE CASE (owner).**
  A rebuild re-walks the scope's sources, so its cost scales with how much a city HAS; an application touches the
  moved source's own deposits, so it costs the same in a 900-building city as in a 3-building one — **the walks
  disappear rather than getting faster**. This is § THE CONTEXTS's payoff one plane up: there, storing
  a fact made cost track EVENT volume instead of READ volume; here, applying a fact makes it track event volume
  instead of SOURCE volume.
  ⚑ **It also makes a promise the specs already print come TRUE.** [validation.md](specs/validation.md) states
  that *"the only path to a rebuild is a mark, so per-turn cost tracks what CHANGED — mark volume, which is event
  volume"* — which holds only if a mark is cheap. While a mark triggers a walk the real cost is
  `events × sources-at-scope`, i.e. the dominant term is the one the sentence omits. Under the maintained sum the
  sentence is literally true, which is [turn time is king](#-the-per-scope-package-model--the-cascades-founding-design-1-stated-as-cache-architecture)
  getting the property it was written for.
  ⚠ **What legitimately still walks, so the claim is not overstated:** the CONDITIONED tail evaluates when its
  dependency moves (bounded by the reverse index, never by the scope); the cross-scope roll-up at read sums the
  ~5 packages the object sits under, which IS the design (§1).
- **⚑ PLANES B AND C ARE WHAT THE SOURCE FACT CANNOT ANSWER, and together they are the whole of the residue.** A
  Forge's `+1 happiness while powered` moves when the POWER moves though the Forge did nothing, so it rides the
  ATOM's route (plane C); a `per: {POPULATION}` deposit moves when the population moves, so it rides the COUNT's
  route (plane B). Neither rides the building's.
  ⛔ Both routes are REVERSE INDICES derived from the compiled deposit index — atom → the deposits it gates,
  count-key → the deposits it scales — never a sweep of the scope's deposits asking each whether it cares, and
  never hand-written ([reverse lookups are populated once, at load](#1-one-step-deposit-down-accumulate-read-o1)).
- **⚖ ORDER-INDEPENDENCE IS FREE, and it is what makes LOAD stop being a special case.** Addition commutes, so an
  accumulate needs no arrival order — exactly the property [spine.md](spine.md) already
  demands of facts. The banked-marks bracket existed because *a rebuild mid-read evaluates against
  half-deserialized state*; an application of a compiled constant evaluates nothing, so it has no such hazard.
  **Only the CONDITIONED tail genuinely needs the `GAME_LOAD_STARTED`..`FINISHED` bracket**, because only it
  reads state the stream may not have delivered yet.
  ⚠ **Consumer registration order remains a contract for that half** (consumers dispatch in registration order):
  **contexts → enabler → modifier → triggers**. Anything that EVALUATES a condition registers after the contexts
  whose stores that condition reads.

### ⚖ WHY DELTA-DERIVING FAILED BEFORE — two preconditions, both now met (owner)

> *"The reason delta-deriving failed in the old model was because there was no unified eventing system, and
> random event yields was baked in, and not as a separate source."*

This is the archaeology that makes the retired protocol legible, and it matters because without it a reader
concludes delta was TRIED AND FOUND WANTING. It was not: it was unavailable.

1. **No unified eventing.** With no complete fact stream, the only honest statement a system could make was
   *"something in here moved"* — which is exactly what a staleness flag encodes. The flag was the best available
   statement, not a preference. ⇒ **The spine was never only an observability project; it is the precondition
   that makes the cache unnecessary**, which is why it had to land first.
2. **⛔ ONE-SHOT EVENT GRANTS WERE BAKED INTO THE SAME ACCUMULATOR AS THE DERIVABLE DEPOSITS — and that is the
   one that actually poisoned it.** Such a slot can be maintained by NEITHER mechanism: you cannot DELTA it,
   because the event contribution has no live source to withdraw against; and you cannot RECOMPUTE it either,
   because recomputing WIPES the grant. The accumulator becomes unrecoverable — the history pollution
   [the uniform legacy-accumulator cut](#-the-legacy-accumulator-cut--every-accumulator-one-uniform-mechanism) describes. ⚑ So the old model was not
   choosing recompute OVER delta; with a baked-in grant both were broken, and recompute was the one that failed
   quietly.

**Both preconditions are now satisfied** — the spine carries the facts, and the event/vote grant has been split
into its own persisted store outside the derivation (§ Event/vote grants, above: *"having events just be stored
in the cache is lunacy"*; the reader sums `derivable + persisted`). The model that failed then is not the model
specified here.

⛔ **THE GUARD, so it cannot recur — and it is the test to run on any slot, not a historical note.**
**Can EVERY contribution to this slot be attributed to a live source that announces itself?**
- **YES** ⇒ the maintained sum holds.
- **NO** ⇒ the non-derivable part is a SEPARATE STORE and is never folded in.

⚠ The failure is silent, which is why it needs a test rather than vigilance: a baked-in one-shot grant leaves the
number entirely plausible while making the slot unmaintainable by any mechanism at all.

### ⛔ THE COST IS THE FORCING FUNCTION — a saturated emit surface is now STRUCTURAL, not a discipline (owner)

> *"We have to take that cost — the system will by its very definition collapse if we do not saturate with
> events."*

A maintained sum fails differently from a recomputed one, and the difference is the POINT:

| | a MISSED emit leaves | how it reads |
|---|---|---|
| recompute-on-mark | a stale but internally consistent value | **plausible forever** — nobody looks |
| **the maintained sum** | a phantom contribution nothing later clears, compounding on repetition | **loud, and louder over time** |

⚑ **That is [self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban) carried to its conclusion rather than a weakness
accepted against it.** The rule already says a missed invalidation must surface as a live divergence instead of
being swept away; between two failure modes, the one that ANNOUNCES itself is the one the rule asks for. ⛔ So
this is never a licence to relax the emit surface "because the number self-corrects" — nothing self-corrects,
and that is deliberate.

⚑ **It also promotes the roadmap's ordering from a preference to a law.** *"The EMIT surface comes first; the
cache build is the step AFTER"* was sequencing advice under recompute; under a maintained sum an unsaturated
spine cannot produce a correct number **at all**, so completeness of the emit surface is a PRECONDITION of the
cascade being right rather than a quality target it trends toward.
⇒ Every ruling that pushes the emit surface toward exhaustive — *"add all the events, ever"*, *"too many events
is better than not enough"*, [an event gap is closed the moment it is found](spine.md#-a-fact-names-the-happening--something-changed-is-not-a-fact-owner) — is load-bearing
on this model, not enthusiasm.

⚠ **The bound on the damage, so the trade is stated honestly: a phantom lives at most ONE SESSION.** Nothing
derived is serialized, so LOAD rebuilds every slot from the reseed's own facts — the history pollution that makes
a legacy serialized accumulator unrecoverable ([the uniform legacy-accumulator cut](#-the-legacy-accumulator-cut--every-accumulator-one-uniform-mechanism))
cannot accrue here. What NAMES it inside that session is the THREE-LEG check — the logs, the JSON info and what
state expects ([http-endpoints.md](specs/http-endpoints.md)).

### ⚖ AND IT IS THE EASIER CORRECTNESS PROBLEM — the deciding argument (owner)

> *"It is far easier to ensure we have all the events, than to ensure that we have all packages correctly
> marked."*

This holds independently of the cost trade above, and it is the reason to prefer the maintained sum even where
the two models would perform alike. The mark model needs **two** censuses complete; the maintained sum needs
**one** — and the one it drops is the harder of the pair:

|  | the EMIT census | the MARK census |
|---|---|---|
| the question | *does this mutation choke point announce?* | *does this fact reach every slot it could move, at every scope, for every owner?* |
| where it is answerable | **LOCALLY**, at the setter — read it and you know | **NOWHERE local** — the answer lives in the authored data |
| moves with the DATA? | no — an emit is engine mechanism | **YES** — a newly authored deposit can silently need a new route |
| safe to over-include? | **YES** — a surplus emit costs one consumer branch that declines | **NO** — a surplus mark is a real rebuild on the turn path |

⛔ **That last row is decisive, and it is already the spec's own rule** ([spine.md](spine.md):
*"emit liberally, mark precisely"*). Over-inclusion is the technique that makes a completeness census tractable —
it is how the enabler's reverse index is allowed to be safe ([enabler.md §5](specs/enabler.md): over-inclusion
is SAFE, a miss is the bug) — and the mark derivation is the one surface that cannot use it. A census that must
be EXACT, over a surface that moves with authored data, has no cheap verification at all.

⚑ **The emit census is owed ANYWAY, which is what makes dropping the other one a pure deletion.** The enabler,
the contexts, the trigger plane, the file log, the `/events` stream and the out-of-process replay all already
depend on the emit surface being complete. The mark derivation was a SECOND census serving one consumer, whose
correctness nothing else in the engine was ever checking.

⚑ **And a missing EMIT is multiply-observable** — a wrong availability verdict, an empty context store, a silent
`/events` frame, a missing log line — while a missing MARK is observable in exactly one package, on one plane,
and only by someone already looking at it. The easier failure to find is the one to keep.

- **ONE read surface, and it is a bare fetch.** `CvCascadePackage::readFlat/readPercent` is the whole of
  it: a package has no second, rebuild-triggering read to reach for, so a cross-scope input needs no ordering
  guarantee and the load bracket has nothing to drain. **THERE IS NO GATE ON A READ** — nothing is tested on it,
  because nothing on it can recompute.
- **The served surfaces are STORED-side only** (`/computed/*`, [http-endpoints.md](specs/http-endpoints.md)):
  each serves what the events built, DECOMPOSED term by term (`CvCascadePackage::readValuesInto`,
  `EnablerKernel::operatingBuildings`, `CascadeCapabilities::storedUnion`, and the yield census), rendered in
  `Sources/Tools/CvStateEndpoints.cpp`, never in the server file.
- ⛔ **THERE IS NO RECOMPUTE-FROM-SOURCE TWIN BESIDE THEM, AND NONE COMES BACK**
  ([superseded-ideas #33](architecture/superseded-ideas.md)): an endpoint cannot replay the event chain, so a from-source
  recompute served beside the stored value is not a second derivation of the same quantity — it answers a number
  that was never comparable, and diffing it produces confident nonsense at scale. **Correctness is the THREE-LEG
  check instead** ([http-endpoints.md](specs/http-endpoints.md)).
  ⚑ Three rulings from that dead shape are kept, because they bind ANY future verification and not just the one
  that died: a check must be **INDEPENDENT** (one that consumes the stored values is partly built on the very
  state it exists to check, so a wrong input is silently inherited and the two sides quietly share a derivation
  again); its **COST IS IRRELEVANT** — *"correct is correct"* (owner) — since it is invoked deliberately and
  never on a turn path, so it is never trimmed, sampled or memoized to look cheap; and it **ANNOUNCES NOTHING**,
  emitting no `[CASCADE] rebuilt` line, because a verification must not move the numbers that describe real work.

## ⚖ THE SPATIAL CARVE-OUT — a PATH is not a maintained sum, so it is a LEGITIMATE cache (owner)

> *"We should have some pathfinding cache, because it is the most expensive, and at the same time
> unmaintainable thing we can do — it has to scan plots by its very definition."*

Everything above says derived state is a MAINTAINED SUM and a cache is a defect. **SPATIAL results are the one
class that rule does not reach, and the reason is structural rather than an exemption granted to them:**

- **A path is not a Σ over sources, so there is no delta to apply.** It moves NON-LOCALLY — one terrain change
  or one new route re-routes paths that do not touch the changed plot at all — so no fact can name the set of
  results it invalidated. [the maintained sum](#-the-maintained-sum--three-planes-one-slot-and-nothing-is-ever-recomputed) needs `Δ(v × c) = v × Δc`; a
  shortest path has no such identity.
- **And it is the most expensive thing the engine does**, because computing one *requires* scanning plots. That
  is the definition of the operation, not an implementation that could be improved into a fetch.

⇒ **So a pathfinding cache is WANTED, and deleting one is a regression.** `PATHFINDING_CACHE` /
`PATHFINDING_VALIDITY_CACHE` are legitimate; so is `CvPlot`'s path-validity memo and the culture-distance
cache — `cultureDistance`, culture spread and the property propagators are all SPATIAL permanent carve-outs,
for exactly this reason.

⛔ **What the carve-out does NOT license.** It is scoped to results that are genuinely spatial:
- **not** an ordinary derived value that merely feels expensive — if a fact can name what moved it, it is a
  maintained sum and the cache is the defect ([a staleness flag is the fossil of a missing emit](#-a-staleness-flag-is-the-fossil-of-an-incomplete-emit-surface--the-same-rule-one-level-up));
- **not** a read-side `ensure()` — a spatial cache is filled at its own INVALIDATION point, never lazily on a
  read that is specified as a bare fetch (the tombstoned protocol, [superseded-ideas](architecture/superseded-ideas.md) #14);
- **not** freedom from invalidation. Being unmaintainable-by-delta means it is CLEARED, wholesale, by the
  events that can move it (terrain, route, ownership) — a spatial cache still has to be wrong for nobody.

## ⛔ `CvDerivedCache` IS REPLACED BY `ContextDict` — VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE (owner)

> *"`CvDerivedCache` should be replaced by `ContextDict` virtually everywhere needed, and we just need to start
> taking one cluster at a time with event wiring."*

**`CvDerivedCache` (`Sources/Infrastructure/CvDerivedCache.h`) no longer exists.** It was a templated
mark→recompute value-holder — a `markDirty` that triggered a recompute over the owner's current state, exactly
the calculation a fact was supposed to make unnecessary. Every tenant converted, one cluster (an entity's facts
plus the store they feed) at a time: its events re-cut to name their happenings
([spine.md](spine.md) § A FACT NAMES THE HAPPENING), its store re-expressed as a keyed
accumulator ([every derived store is a keyed accumulator](#-every-derived-store-is-one-shape--a-keyed-accumulator-maintained-by-a-delta-owner)) or a channel slot in
`CvCascadePackage` (§ THE MAINTAINED SUM, above), and its recompute deleted in the same change. The legacy
`CvCity` hand-rolled staleness caches (`m_aiCommerceRate`, `m_aiBuildingCommerce100`, squirrelBanana) went the
same way.

⛔ **It is not reintroduced, and not reached for "just this once."** A recompute is only ever necessary when
inputs arrive UNANNOUNCED, which a saturated emit surface makes impossible
([a staleness flag is the fossil of a missing emit](#-a-staleness-flag-is-the-fossil-of-an-incomplete-emit-surface--the-same-rule-one-level-up)) — a surviving tenant would be a MISSING EMIT wearing a
component, the same shape a staleness flag wears one level out. The boundary between the two replacements —
keyed count vs summed magnitude — is § EVERY DERIVED STORE IS ONE SHAPE, above.

---

## 2. The combine arithmetic

Per `(family, member, unit, target)`, the slot composes the three value units ([json](specs/json.md) §3.6):

> **`effective = (base + Σflat) × (100 + Σpercent)/100 × Π(multiplier/100)`**

`flat`s sum into the base; `percent`s (additive deltas) sum then apply once; `multiplier`s compose by product.
`Σflat`, `Σpercent`, and `Πmultiplier` (flats + multipliers stored ×100, identity 100; a PERCENT is NOT
scaled — [the ×100 fixed-point model](specs/curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries)) are each their own accumulated number —
**the `unit` is part of the slot KEY (per `(family, member, unit, target)`), so a flat sum and a percent sum
are SEPARATE slots, never fields of one mixed struct** — the separation is what lets invalidation split
percent-vs-flat (§1). One `deposit(unit, value)` folds a value into its unit's slot; `effective(base)`
combines them at read.

All integer, ×100 fixed-point throughout ([the ×100 fixed-point model](specs/curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries)):
the single human→×100 conversion happened once in `readJson` ([json](specs/json.md) §3.6); the slot does pure integer
math and never sees the human boundary.

> **⛔ PLOT SCALING CAN ONLY AFFECT ITSELF — A HARD RULE (owner).** *"I do not think there is any scenario where a
> plot gives 1 hammer per 5 commerce, and as such we codify that as a hard rule, that the plot scaling can only
> effect itself."* A per-plot scaling of a channel reads that channel's own value on that plot and grants THAT

## 2a. The realized RATE — what is BASE, what is added AFTER the percentages

The §2-combine above is the *generic* slot. A city's **per-channel yield/commerce RATE** — `InfoValuation::cityRate`
for yields and `InfoValuation::commerceSplit` for the commerce channels, the value a citizen's worked output
finally becomes — is that combine applied with a **sharp two-tier shape**. This is the model the rate computation
must reproduce, and the order is load-bearing (it decides what the percent stack scales and what it doesn't):

> **`rate100 = (BASE + specialists) × modifier⁄100  +  100 × ⌊EXTRA100 ⁄ 100⌋`**
>
> `modifier = max(0, 100 + Σpercent)` (so `×modifier⁄100` ≡ `×(1 + Σ%)`). Everything is ×100 fixed-point integer.

### TIER 1 — BASE (everything the percent stack MULTIPLIES)

| BASE source | origin | base vs computed |
|---|---|---|
| **worked-plot yields** (`basePlotYield`) | Σ over the city's worked plots of each plot's ONE isolated base package (§2 plot-as-base): `max(0, terrain+feature+bonus)` nature + improvement (floored at −nature) + route + keyed building/civic/trait `plot`-flats + `plots`-target + city-centre constant + threshold/golden-age per-plot | **computed** from the curated plot substrate + engine plot state |
| **trade-route yield** (`tradeYield`) | engine-generated (the trade network) — ⚖ **already carrying its OWN percent layer, see below** | **input** — out-of-scope: the cascade cannot re-derive the network, so the calc *folds the route yield in*, never derives it. **The ONE live-yield input** — a clean addition at the very end of the base, and the sole sanctioned exception to the pollution guardrail ([validation](specs/validation.md), [the pollution guardrail](specs/validation.md#the-pollution-guardrail--engine-computed-data-never-rides-in)). ⚠ **The route COUNT is the OPPOSITE case (owner): `getMaxTradeRoutes` — game + player + coastal + `city.extra` slot deposits — is a modifier-influenced value the cascade COMPUTES, its own `tradeRoutes` channel.** Trade YIELD is read from the engine package; the trade-route COUNT is calculated here. Do not conflate them |
| **free-city yield** (`freeCityYield`) | Σ the player's active traits' `YieldChanges` (`{ch}.empire.flat`) | **computed** — derivable from the trait JSON, so it is COMPUTED, never read off the engine; consuming the live value would leave the trait→yield derivation unvalidated ([validation](specs/validation.md) pollution guardrail). ⚠ NAMING: "free-city" here = the legacy trait accumulator (`CvPlayer::m_aiFreeCityYield`, free yield granted in every city) — **NOT** the WLTKD celebration ("We Love the King/Emperor Day"), whose sole gameplay effect is zero city maintenance ([economy.md](reference/economy.md)) |
| **golden-age yield** | trait `goldenAge` member (`{ch}.empire.goldenAge.flat`) while in golden age | **computed** (`empire.goldenAge` member-mirror, §3 golden-age carve-out) |
| **specialist yields** (`specialist`) | per assigned specialist: `intrinsic × (100 + specialist-%)⁄100` + building-local (gated `city.flat`) + per-type (`empire.cities.flat` — the `cities` target lands it in the HOLDING city; a bare `empire.flat` on a specialist would roll down to EVERY city and cascade with city count) + perAll + trait governing-deliverer | **computed**. NOTE the specialist carries its **own** percent layer (its intrinsic ×`(100+specialist-%)`) *before* it joins BASE and takes the city `modifier` — two distinct percent stacks |

> **⚖ HOW `tradeYield` STAYS CURRENT — the ONE value the cascade FEEDS but does not HOLD, so it is REBUILT, not

### TIER 2 — EXTRA (flat, added AFTER the percentages, NEVER multiplied)

| EXTRA source | origin |
|---|---|
| **building flat yields** (`BuildingFlatYield100`) | Σ active (non-dormant) buildings' `{ch}.city.flat` + `{ch}.city.perPopulation` × population |

The EXTRA is held ×100; the `100 × ⌊EXTRA100⁄100⌋` **truncates it to whole units** before re-scaling (the engine's
`getExtraYield100` order — a documented integer-truncation gotcha, not a rounding choice).

> For **§2 commerce** the same two-tier shape holds with the channel's own pieces: BASE = the COMMERCE-yield
> (`InfoValuation::cityRate`'s COMMERCE channel) × the channel slider + the §2 baseExtra sub-terms (religion, corporation, golden-age,
> state-religion pool, player-extra, the building-commerce block); EXTRA (post-modifier) = `production × prodToCommerce`.
> The building-commerce block is itself a pure per-building sum over the building's OWN entries (own-flat + tech +
> bonus + perPop + shrine + corp-HQ + the `CommerceChangeDoubleTime` whole-doubling) — and the building-keyed boosts

### How the percentages "smash together" — ONE additive stack

`modifier` is **a single additive sum** — every active source's `{channel}.<scope>.percent`, added together, then
`max(0,·)`:

- **active buildings** (this city, non-dormant): `city.percent`
- **empire buildings** (every building the player owns anywhere — rolls DOWN to each city): `empire.percent`
- **adopted civics**: `empire.percent`
- **the player's active traits** (the option-selected set, pure-filtered §4): `empire.percent`
- **projects** (commerce channels only; yields find none): `empire.percent`

They are **purely additive** — `+30% +20% −10% = +40%`, applied **once** as `×140⁄100`. The engine keeps these in
*separate accumulators* (`modBuilding`, `modPlayer`, `modCapital`, `modBonus`, `modFromBuildings`, …); the cascade
**unifies them into this one sum** because addition is associative — the per-accumulator split changes nothing the
result can see. `multiplier` deposits (`Π(multiplier⁄100)`, §2) exist in the generic model but are **identity here**:
no yield/commerce source authors a multiplier, so the stack is additive-only and matches legacy exactly.

The two tiers + the single additive stack ARE the coherent shape: a BASE assembled from its sources, scaled **once**
by the unified percent total, with the building FLATs bolted on **after** — never inside — the percentages.

## 2b. The WELLBEING channels — health + happiness (signed-split, the §2a sibling)

The city's **health** and **happiness** levels are the §2 combine over **FOUR ORDINARY CHANNELS (owner)** —
`happiness`, `anger`, `health`, `unhealth` — summed in **opposing pairs** at the verdict: happiness against anger,
health against unhealth. They are four yields like any other, carried on the one uniform package with no special
storage: a source depositing a negative value is routed to the opposing channel **at fill**, so nothing about the
combine or the cache is wellbeing-specific.

**⛔ A CHANNEL *IS* THE LEVEL — there is no separate verdict getter, and the distinction that remains is
DEPOSITS vs REALIZED.** Two reads, and conflating them double-counts:

| read | answers | composes with |
|---|---|---|
| the GROUP read (`getWellbeing`) | the DEPOSITS only — the cascade's roll-up over the scope chain | a CANDIDATE's `expectedWellbeing`, which answers in the same vocabulary ([patterns.md](architecture/patterns.md) § THE TWO READ ROLES) |
| the REALIZED read (`realizedWellbeing`) | deposits **+** the raw-state inputs below | nothing — it is this city's own level |

The raw-state inputs are folded at the REALIZED read, exactly where the engine folds them, so a consumer never
re-derives one. A consumer wanting one side of a pair indexes the array; there is **no per-side getter**.

The **opposing-pair NETS** (`InfoValuation::netHappiness` / `netHealth`) live once on the calc surface, are fed
the four channels rather than an object — which is what lets the same implementation net a city's realized set
and a candidate's expected delta — and are **signed** (a surplus is as meaningful as a deficit). The realized
end-state values are the clamps over them, and are a final-state CALCULATION, never a channel or a getter
([patterns.md](architecture/patterns.md) rule 6): `healthRate = min(0, health − unhealth)`;
`angryPopulation = clamp(anger − happiness, 0, pop)`.

⚠ The wellbeing channel has no decomposition census yet ([http-endpoints](specs/http-endpoints.md)); when the route
table is rebuilt it wants one field per named engine term, so a divergence localises to a single source.

**The TARGET/INPUT split (the tradeYield precedent, [validation](specs/validation.md) input rules):**

- **DEPOSIT-COMPUTED (the cascade's targets)** — everything a live source's `health`/`happiness` family deposits
  produce: **buildings** (city `flat`/`perPopulation` + the empire-scope rollups + conditioned entries incl.
  `HAS_STATE_RELIGION`-gated and the reverse-landed source-keyed boosts — a wonder/civic/tech `buildings.{B}`
  wellbeing deposit is authored deliverer-side (§4) but the readJson reverse pass lands it on the TARGET building
  as a CITY-scope conditioned entry gated on the source's presence at the authored scope, so it reads
  building-side under this term), **civics** (empire flats — incl. the tax-anger deposit, a `happiness.empire`
  entry per-scaled on `GOLD_RATE`, re-booked by the slider-rate count route — + the keyed/heterogeneous members
  read civic-side: `features.{F}`, `nonStateReligion`, the `cities.{unit: IS_MILITARY}` per-unit scaler, the
  ranked `cities` scaler — the civic's `buildings.{B}` member lands building-side per the above), **traits** (same member
  vocabulary), **features** (`health.plot.percent` — summed over radius plots, ÷100 — the fallout class),
  **bonuses** (`empire.cities` flats, presence-gated — ⛔ NEVER a bare `empire` flat: that lands in the empire
  package and rolls DOWN to every city, while the engine applies it on the per-city presence fact, so one
  connected luxury is counted once per holding city and the product handed back to every city. The `cities`
  target lands it in the HOLDING city's package, which is what a luxury means — the cities that HAVE it are
  happier — the same precedent the specialist `cities`-target deposit sets one entity
  over), **specialists** (city flats; the fractional values are the
  curator's ÷100 de-scale of the legacy latent-×100 — the engine `…/100` at use), **corporations**
  (`HAS_CORPORATION`-conditioned city flats), **techs**/**projects** (empire — projects also the lone `world`
  scope)/**handicaps** (empire flats), and **military units** (`happiness.empire.cities.{unit: IS_MILITARY}`
  §3.7). **Religion happiness has NO religion-side data** (verified: legacy religion info carries none) — the
  state/non-state religion terms derive from CIVIC/TRAIT/BUILDING configs × religion presence.
  ⚖ **Improvement health is a BALANCE-CUT (curator ruling, `curate_improvement.py`):** legacy `iHealthPercent`
  is deliberately dropped from the data, so the engine's `improvementGood/Bad` term is an **intentional
  divergence** — attributed by the engine's own `improvementGood100/Bad100` terms, shown, never chased
  ([validation](specs/validation.md) intentional-model-change class); the term dies at the channel's legacy cut.
  ⚖ **Improvement HAPPINESS, by contrast, IS represented** (owner ruling — no gaps): the intrinsic per-radius
  improvement happiness (`happiness.plot.flat` on the improvement) and the civic per-improvement happiness
  (`happiness.empire.improvements.{I}.flat`) are **folded into the feature happiness terms** (`featSubstrate` +
  `featMember`) — because the legacy `getFeatureGoodHappiness` bundles feature + improvement happiness into ONE
  number. Structurally live end-to-end; **zero data carries it today** (schema-only civic field, no improvement
  authors `iHappiness`), so the verdict is unchanged — the path is future-proof for any modder data.
  **Celebrity happiness** is an INPUT; the `skills.celebrity` unit-scan port (the CvCity scan) finishes it.
- **RAW-STATE INPUTS (folded, never derived)** — the runtime timers/counters no deposit produces: the **anger
  percents** (overcrowding = f(pop), noMilitary, foreign-culture, enemy-religion, hurry/conscript/defy/
  revRequest timers, war-weariness, revIndex, civic anger%), the **happiness timer** (`getHappinessTimer` —
  the same countdown shape as the anger timers above, folded on the happiness side: `GC.getTEMP_HAPPY()` while
  the timer runs), the **espionage counters**, **event anger**
  (one-shot event state), **foreign-culture anger**, **landmark anger** (option-gated —
  ⚖ KEEP through the migration: the existing engine implementation stays, *"straight up state derived from the
  plot in question"*; the landmark data pass is a sanctioned separate data pass (#448); the engine impl KEEPS),
  **city-over-limit**, and **vassal** terms. These are saved/derived-from-saved state — legitimate inputs, since
  no deposit produces them and nothing about them is a cascade output ([validation](specs/validation.md) pollution
  guardrail) — and the calc folds them at the level combine exactly where the engine does.
  ⚖ **The `extraHappiness`/`extraHealth` accumulators are EVENT-GRANTED persisted state (owner ruling), a
  SANCTIONED read, not a ride-in:** the CITY `getExtraHappiness`/`getExtraHealth` are written ONLY by `applyEvent`
  (an event granting extra happiness/health) — genuine one-shot non-derivable state (the event-store class,
  § THE MAINTAINED SUM, above); the PLAYER accumulator additionally bundles the
  DERIVABLE trait+tech, which the calc NETS OUT (− engine trait/tech + the cascade nets), keeping only the
  event/unattributed residual. Wiring these as proper cascade event grants is **event-rework scope** (#425 events
  stay Python / the F3 grants apply-loop), NOT a modifier-cut ride-in to fix here.
- **GATE FLAGS** — the `abolished<Channel>` amenity family ([json.md §8](specs/json.md)) zeroes its side wholesale.
  They are **HARD OFF-SWITCHES, never modifiers (owner)**: while a live grantor confers one *"unhappiness does
  not exist in the city"* — the side ceases to exist rather than being reduced, so the combine drops the whole
  channel instead of subtracting from it.
  ⛔ **The gate asks the CITY, never a grantor** — `CvCity::isNoUnhappiness` /
  `isNoUnhealthyPopulation` / `isBuildingOnlyHealthy` are folds over the city's `amenities`
  (§ THE CONTEXTS, below), so a WHERE rides the grant's own `enabled` condition and is
  evaluated per receiver at fold time. There is no hand-named counter and no per-key grantor read to reach for.
  ⚑ **No BUILDING authors one, and that is DELIBERATE — the mechanic is "wildly overpowered" (owner)** — so
  finding the building side unauthored is never licence to author one, and equally never a reason to purge the
  key as unused. ⚠ The CHANNEL is nonetheless LIVE: a civic confers `abolishedAnger` gated `IS_CAPITAL`, which
  is what retired the legacy key that baked the capital into its name
  ([conditions are predicates, never bespoke members](specs/json.md#35-predicates--a-systems-runtime-state-query)).
- **`unhealthyPopulation`** (= `max(0, pop − angryPop)` unless flagged) enters the BAD side as the engine's
  population term — a state-derived input (it reads the happiness verdict; the calc computes it from its own
  happiness result, never reads the engine's).

⚠ Two engine quirks the calc reproduces verbatim — named here so the reproduction is DELIBERATE and visible rather
than accidental. Whether they survive is a SPEC decision (the spec leads), never a silent "fix" at a call site:
`badHealth` adds `min(0, extraBuildingBadHealth)` **twice** (once inside `totalBadBuildingHealth`, once
directly); and the anger percents scale by `pop/PERCENT_ANGER_DIVISOR` with truncating integer division.

**⛔ TRAVELING UNIT MODIFIERS RIDE ON TOP (GENERAL — all channels).** A modifier that
TRAVELS with a unit (unit-sourced happiness, anger, property emission, and any future unit-carried channel
value) is **never part of a cached cascade computation**: it is computed LIVE at read and **added on top as a
FLAT term, after and outside every percentage modification**. Two structural consequences: (1) unit movement
never dirties any cache — the cached sums are unit-free by construction; (2) the traveling value is a plain
flat addition to the realized number, never an input to a percent stack. The implementation shape: the cache
stores the unit-free number (+ any epoch-stable per-unit multiplier, e.g. a civic's per-military-unit VALUE);
the read folds `perUnit × liveCount` / the live unit walk on top (an O(1)-ish live engine read).
**The AUTHORING BAN that keeps this coherent: no unit gives — or can ever be
ALLOWED to give — PERCENTAGES to yields of any kind.** A unit-carried value is always a raw flat number on
top; a unit-authored percent would force units back inside the cached percent stacks and break the whole
on-top model. Enforceable at the curator/validation layer: a `units/**` JSON authoring a yield/commerce
`percent` deposit is a data error.
Ledgered as [unit-carried modifiers apply on top, live, never cached](#2b-the-wellbeing-channels--health--happiness-signed-split-the-2a-sibling).

**UNIT-driven wellbeing is END-TURN cadence.** The military/unit-count happiness
term recomputes **once per turn** (the substrate's turn-roll), NEVER per unit move — a per-move mark hook made
every post-move rate read pay the wellbeing walk (a measured unit-automation collapse) and is banned. The
within-turn lag this leaves on the wellbeing slots (a handful of cities whose garrison changed mid-turn) is the
RULED cadence, not a freshness hole; the getter flip proceeds with it.

**The STORED-ACCUMULATOR DRIFT class.** The legacy wellbeing terms are
INCREMENTAL SERIALIZED accumulators (`m_iBonusGood/BadHappiness`, `m_iBuildingGood/BadHappiness`,
`m_paiStateReligionHappiness`, `m_iExtraBuilding*FromTech`, …) — event-sourced numbers that carry decades of
save history. **The old cache model folded event-type grants DIRECTLY into these caches** (there is no separate
event-yield data — the per-building `m_aBuildingHappy/HealthChange` ledgers carry nothing on real saves), so a
stored value that disagrees with its current-state recompute is **DRIFT (history pollution), never
event state to preserve**. ⛔ The `*Recomputed` twin that once stood beside each incremental accumulator is
GONE, and so is the comparison surface it fed ([superseded-ideas #17](architecture/superseded-ideas.md): zero
such symbols remain). A stored-vs-recompute divergence of this class is **engine-wrong / cascade-right** and is
repaired by the slots recomputing from data — never by re-adding a twin to measure it with.

---

## The contexts — the per-scope live-state read surface

> The live-state object a cascade getter and the one condition evaluator read to compute an entity's ACTUAL value in
> a given place. One per game-object scope that needs it: **PlotContext** (`CvPlot`), **CityContext** (`CvCity`),
> **EmpireContext** (`CvPlayer`). Owner rulings; this is the concrete shape the "make the infos sane"
> `(cityContext, plotGroup)` getters ([patterns.md § INFO DATA-OUT](architecture/patterns.md)) read.

**A context is cascade OUTPUT, not a separate "input" kind (owner):** *"contexts, when thinking about it,
are in essence the output of the cascade."* Same scopes, same spine, never serialized, rebuilt by the same
reseed, read as the same bare fetch — and maintained the same way, by the fact that names the source
([the maintained sum](#-the-maintained-sum--three-planes-one-slot-and-nothing-is-ever-recomputed)). What differs is only WHO CONSUMES the
value: a package answers a magnitude, a context store answers a gate. ⚠ That is a statement about the consumer,
never about the kind of thing being stored, and treating it as two planes is what let them drift onto opposite
maintenance mechanisms before this page merged them back into one.

### The one idea — isolate the CHANGEABLE state a reader needs, per scope, in ONE understandable place

A building's output getter computes the ACTUAL benefit in a city, which depends on that city's live state (its
connected/vicinity bonuses, river/coast plots, power, religions, …). Rather than every getter reaching into the
`CvCity`/`CvPlayer` god-objects ad hoc, each game object that a reader needs owns **one context** — the single,
predictable home for that object's changeable state. The **symmetry IS the value**: a reader always knows where to
go (city state → `CityContext`, empire state → `EmpireContext`, plot state → `PlotContext`).

**Isolation is for RESPONSIBILITY, not decoupling (owner).** The context is bound to its game object by pointer and
freely reaches into it — coupling is fine when the structure is ironclad. The goal is a clean responsibility line
(this object is THE state surface for its scope), never running detached from the live object.

### What a context STORES vs FORWARDS — ⛔ a context is an EVENT-BUILT STORE, not a forwarding facade (owner)

**"Context should be built on events — that is the design of it."** And the purpose of storing is that the state
becomes DISTINGUISHABLE: *"so that an info can say 'yes, I will actually deliver this, based on this state.'"*
A context that merely forwards to its bound object delivers none of that — it is the same pointer hop with an
extra name, so the design collapses into "pass the god-object like always."

The split is by **DERIVED vs RAW**, not by convenience:

- **STORE — every DERIVED fact the evaluation reads.** Predicate verdicts, aggregates, unions: computed ONCE by
  the ONE derivation for that fact and maintained by the spine events, never recomputed at read. This is the
  context's substance. It is derived state, so it is **never serialized** and is rebuilt at load by the reseed
  ([derived data is never trusted from a save](specs/save.md#5-derived-data-serializes-nothing-), [the load reseed](spine.md#5-the-load-reseed)).
- **FORWARD — only the object's OWN RAW data** that it already maintains O(1) (the substrate ids a parameterized
  predicate keys on, population, …). Forwarding raw data is not duplication; storing a second copy of it would be.

⚑ **THE PAYOFF — this is why the design earns its cost (owner): once contexts are PURELY event-updated, an
enormous class of per-read CALCULATION becomes obsolete.** Not "gets faster" — ceases to exist. Every read-time
scan/union/walk collapses into a stored value some event already maintained, and reads become bare fetches
(§ THE MAINTAINED SUM, above; [turn time is king](#-the-per-scope-package-model--the-cascades-founding-design-1-stated-as-cache-architecture)).
The in-tree exhibits are not hypothetical: `isCoastalLand()` is an 8-neighbour scan **per predicate
evaluation**, and the §5a vicinity check is a radius union **per check**. The win is STRUCTURAL: once the fact
is stored there is no read-time work left to do, so cost tracks EVENT volume (what changed), never read volume
(how often it is asked) — and it is observed where every performance claim is observed, on the per-turn wall
clock ([turn time is king](#-the-per-scope-package-model--the-cascades-founding-design-1-stated-as-cache-architecture)).

⛔ **BUT THE TEST IS A SCAN, NOT A HOP — and `getNumBonuses` is the case that marks the line.** What earns a
store is read-time work that GROWS with something (neighbours, radius tiles, a registry). A read that resolves
through a POINTER to the object which already owns the number O(1) is not that, and storing it anyway makes a
third copy of one fact ([enabler.md §8](specs/enabler.md) RESIDENCY: the plot group owns the network count,
the city relays it, the context forwards the relay). ⚠ This one had a store on exactly that mistaken reading,
and it cost a sweep of every bonus on every fact that could move one — strictly more work than the hop it was
avoiding. **Ask what the read WALKS; if the answer is "one pointer", forward it.**

> **⛔ SO A CONSUMER NEVER WALKS AN INFO'S KEYED LIST TO ASK A PER-ITEM LIVE-STATE QUESTION — THE EVENT-BUILT
> READ-ONLY STATE ANSWERS IT (owner).** *"There should be no iterating like that; the eventspine-built read-only
> should be able to handle that."* The shape to recognise is `foreach_(key in someInfo.getKeyedList()) { …
> liveStateRead(key) … }` — the info supplies the keys and the loop asks the live state once per key. That is the
> per-read scan this whole section deletes, merely sourced from an info instead of from the map.
> ⚑ **The worked case is the corporation's consumed bonuses:** `foreach_(bonus in corp's bonuses) getNumBonuses(bonus)`
> re-executes [enabler.md §8](specs/enabler.md)'s hottest cluster once PER BONUS, and where the question is a
> MAGNITUDE the answer is already authored — the rate carries a `per:{anyOf: consumed bonuses}` scaler, so the
> valuation resolves rate × count in one call and the loop simply disappears.
> ⛔ **And renaming the receiver is NOT the fix.** A walk that compiles against the new getter reads as migrated
> while doing exactly what it did before — the half-migration
> ([build a new getter surface, never widen a legacy one](architecture/patterns.md#-the-two-read-roles--one-grammar-two-answers-owner)), and it hides the hole the maintained read has
> not yet filled ([legacy must fail loud, never mask a cascade gap](specs/validation.md#legacy-must-fail-loud-never-mask-a-cascade-gap)). Leave such a site DANGLING as the
> census entry it is until the maintained fetch exists.

⛔ **A forwarded read that COMPUTES is the defect this rule exists to kill.** `PlotContext::hasCoast()` forwarding
to `CvPlot::isCoastalLand()` — an 8-neighbour scan with an `area()->getNumTiles()` call per neighbour, on every
predicate evaluation — is the worked example, and it directly contradicts
[patterns.md](architecture/patterns.md): *"every evaluator predicate is an O(1) CONTEXT fetch … a predicate that walks
plots/units per call is the efficiency defect to reject in review."*

**The storage is keyed by the CONDITION VOCABULARY** — that is what makes the state distinguishable. One key
space (`CASC_PRED_*` / the classification ids), three granularities of the same design:

| context | stores | granularity |
|---|---|---|
| **PlotContext** | the plot's own predicate verdicts | a `CASC_PRED_*` BITSET |
| **CityContext** | `plotAttrs` | per-predicate COUNTS over the same keys — the FOLD of its member plots' bits |
| **EmpireContext** | `policies` | the `POLICY_*` id set (the union over live civics + held traits) |

So the city aggregate is not a second derivation: `CvCity::onCityPlotChanged(plot, ±1)` folds the plot's bits,
and the two granularities cannot drift.

⚠ **Adjacency-derived predicates fan out.** `HAS_COAST` / fresh-water depend on NEIGHBOURS, so the event that
changes a plot re-derives that plot's own bits AND its adjacent plots' adjacency bits. Bounded (8 neighbours) and
event-driven — never a read-time scan, and never left on the old accessor as an interim.

| context | owner | STORES (unique aggregate) | FORWARDS (read through the bound object / its owner) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CityContext** | `CvCity` | `plotAttrs` — per-predicate plot COUNTS (the fold of member plots' bits) · **`amenities`** — the `AMENITY_*` id→COUNT fold over the city's OPERATING buildings + the empire-scope grantors (json §8; the count is load-bearing — see the callout below) · **the VICINITY BONUSES available in the city** (owner) — the §5a radius union, MAP half (see the split below) · the **AREA facts** (area id, its tile count, the coastal water-body size) · the **holy-city and HEADQUARTERS counts** — how many religions / corporations name this city, each a delta store fed ±1 by its own fact · the **CORPORATION-ACTIVE verdicts** — the remembered per-corp `{HAS_CORPORATION}` verdict, held ONLY so its crossing can announce (`SEVT_CITY_CORPORATION_ACTIVE_ADDED / _REMOVED`, the fact plane C routes on): each leg's fact triggers a re-read of the ONE engine implementation (`CvCity::isActiveCorporation`, the sanctioned engine-owned input — the read side stays the live forward), and a re-read that moved nothing announces nothing | population, power, religion presence, holy-city-of, corporation, capital, government-centre, fresh-water access, property value (raw, `CvCity`-owned, O(1)); state religion (→ owner `CvPlayer`); **the TRADED count** — the gated network number, forwarded through `CvCity::getNumBonuses`, which relays to the PLOT GROUP that owns it ([enabler.md §8](specs/enabler.md) RESIDENCY: nothing mirrors the group); **the CURRENT REALIZED YIELDS** (owner) — the city's own O(1) group read, forwarded so a valuation can resolve a percent against a real base (below); **the CURRENT REALIZED COMMERCE** — `CvCity::getCommerces`, the per-commerce SPLIT of that commerce yield by the empire's sliders plus each channel's own deposits (§2a), forwarded for the same reason |
| **EmpireContext** | `CvPlayer` | `policies` — the empire's enacted-policy set (the derived UNION over live civics'/traits' policy blocks, stored nowhere else) · **the HELD-TRAIT set** — the `TRAIT_` id→COUNT fold, a delta store fed ±1 by the trait facts (§ the callout below: enumerating what a player holds is a SCAN even though testing one trait is a hop) | state religion (single enum → `CvPlayer::getStateReligion`), civics/**trait presence**/heritages, the team-held facts; **the CURRENT REALIZED COMMERCE** — `CvPlayer::getCommerces`, the four empire RECEIVER totals: the city-yields forward's empire twin, so an empire-scope percent resolves against a real base; **the COMMERCE SLIDER PERCENTAGES** (owner) — the player's gold / research / culture / espionage rates, the `GOLD_RATE`/`RESEARCH_RATE`/`CULTURE_RATE`/`ESPIONAGE_RATE` tokens ([json.md §3.1](specs/json.md)); a group keyed by `CommerceTypes`, forwarded because `CvPlayer` owns them O(1) |
| **PlotContext** | `CvPlot` | the `CASC_PRED_*` verdict **BITSET** — the OWN-PLOT block (water/land/relief/hills/peak/river/irrigation/feature-present/landmark/owned/**worked**) plus the ADJACENCY block (coast, fresh-water) · **`workableBy`** — the cities whose potential work area this plot is in, set by `CvCity::changeWorkableArea` and announced per plot (§ the VICINITY store) | the RAW substrate a parameterized predicate keys on — terrain/feature/improvement/route/bonus ids, owner, latitude, nature yield — plus city-presence, the one verdict with no mutation event a bit could be maintained from (→ `CvPlot`); **the plot's CURRENT REALIZED YIELDS** — `CvPlot::getYields`, the whole isolated per-plot base package as a bare cache fetch. ⛔ The PRE-IMPROVEMENT leg (`natureYield`) is a SECOND SLOT of that same package, never a per-call computation: it is asked per (plot × improvement × yield) by the placement gate and both improvement valuations, which is the cost class this whole section deletes. A read that recomputes it is the forwarded-read-that-COMPUTES defect above, and the number is already in the package |

⛔ **THE VICINITY SPLIT — the context holds the MAP half, the enabler holds the BUILDING half.** The §5a in-vicinity
supply is a union of two independently-owned halves, and storing either one twice is the duplication the model bans:

- **MAP providers** (a bonus on a radius tile providing itself) are per-scope live state with no other home, so
  `CityContext` holds them — tiered by the §3.4 ownership discriminator (`owned` / owned+neutral / `crossBorder` /
  `worked`), since the `vicinity` band selects which tiles count — the plot-set axis, distinct from `connection`.
- **ACTIVE BUILDING providers** (`provides.bonuses`) are the operate/provides **least fixpoint**, which only the
  enabler can resolve — an operate condition may consume a bonus another active building provides. They stay
  `OperatingBuildings::provided`, reached through `CvCascadeEvalCtx::vicinityProvidedBonuses`.

The reader unions the two. A mirror of the building half on the context would also *drift*, because the enabler
mutates its set in place as the fixpoint ripples.

> **⚖ THE MAP HALF IS TWO DICTIONARIES, NOT ONE — bonuses, and natural features (owner).** *"There is nothing
> wrong with having 2 dictionaries, 1 for bonuses and 1 for natural features; what I don't want is the constant

⚖ **`CityContext.amenities` — THE CITY'S OWN FEATURE LIST, AND THE CITY IS WHAT GETS CHECKED (owner).** A
grantor's `amenities` block ([json.md §8](specs/json.md)) is static info data; what a consumer actually asks
is *"does THIS CITY have this?"*. So the city holds the FOLD — over its **operating** buildings, plus the
empire-scope grantors (civic / trait / tech) that reach every city — and every gate reads it O(1). ⛔ A consumer
must never loop the city's buildings asking each one, and a grantor's per-key named getter is not the consumer
surface: the fold is the ONE reader of the grantor side
([the DRY single-implementation law](architecture/patterns.md#dry--one-implementation-per-calculation--evaluation-the-single-source-law)), alongside display/pedia.

> **⛔ IT IS A ContextDict (id→COUNT), NOT A BITSET (owner) — absent or 0 is false, anything else true.** Several

> ⚠ **Both halves are needed, and the load ordering is NOT uniform across grantors:** the civic reseed emits

**Every boolean city attribute of this shape is generalized onto the ONE fold, not just power:**
`governmentCenter`, `abolishedAnger`, `abolishedUnhealthFromPopulation` and `abolishedUnhealthFromBuildings` are
all ordinary `CITY_HAS_AMENITY` keys (`CvCity::isGovernmentCenter` / `isNoUnhappiness` /
`isNoUnhealthyPopulation` / `isBuildingOnlyHealthy`), so a NEW attribute of this shape costs no engine
change — it is pure data, the open-registry promise ([the classification-infos registry](specs/json.md#8-classification--unit-skillstagsstate-building-attributes--empire-capabilities))
reaching the consumer side. ⛔ There is no surviving hand-named counter for any of them — no
`changeGovernmentCenterCount` / `changeNoUnhappinessCount` / `changeNoUnhealthyPopulationCount` member on
`CvCity` — the fold replaced them, exactly what
[every derived cache is one shape](#-every-derived-store-is-one-shape--a-keyed-accumulator-maintained-by-a-delta-owner) asks for.

⚠ **Two attributes that LOOK like the same family are deliberately NOT on this fold, and neither is a hole to
close by routing it there.** `governmentCenterDistance()` is a separately STORED value (§ the sanctioned-recalc
exemplar, below) because it answers a MIN over the player's centres — a different question from
`isGovernmentCenter()`, which the amenity fold already answers. And `HAS_FRESHWATER` is a **`PlotContext`** bit,
not a `CityContext` amenity, that deliberately keeps calling the live `CvPlot::isFreshWater` engine predicate
rather than folding onto a dictionary (§ the adjacency callout, below —
[the DRY single-implementation law](architecture/patterns.md#dry--one-implementation-per-calculation--evaluation-the-single-source-law)).

**Pass by reference/pointer, never by value (owner).** Passing a bound context is far cheaper than snapshotting
values; a context is never a value copy — that is *why* it forwards rather than mirrors.

**⚖ THE TWO PASS-IN SCENARIOS (owner) — a context crosses a call boundary in exactly TWO places, the two
condition-evaluation sites:** (1) **the VALUATION** — the `expected*` per-group reads and the package rebuild's
conditioned-deposit evaluation (the same machinery at event cadence); (2) **the `requires` edge** — the
enabler's build/operate gate incl. the operating-set fixpoint, re-run at HAVE-change over the affected
candidates. Both go through the ONE evaluator over the eval ctx the contexts fill. Every other read on every
surface is a straight compiled fetch and NEVER takes a context parameter — a context in any other signature is
the mechanical smell that condition evaluation (or an ad-hoc state reach) is happening where it doesn't belong.

### ⛔ THE EVAL CTX CARRIES CONTEXTS, NOT GAME OBJECTS (owner) — the contract must be STRUCTURAL

**"Otherwise we can just pass the full player, city, and whatever other objects again, without any
distinguishing."** That is the whole test, and it is a CONTRACT, not a prohibition: if the evaluation context
holds a `CvCity*`/`CvPlayer*`, then "the reader goes through the context" is enforced only by reviewer memory —
the god-object is right there, and reaching past the context is one `->` away (a derived
`&ctx.city->getCityContext()` is the tell: the ctx never held a context at all). The isolation must be
**unsayable to violate**, exactly as [patterns.md](architecture/patterns.md) states the info DATA-OUT contract: there is no
member to reach through.

So `CvCascadeEvalCtx` carries **`const CityContext*` / `const EmpireContext*` / `const PlotContext*`** — never
the bound game objects. Consequences, each already implied by the model above:

- **TEAM facts route through `EmpireContext`** (team is deliberately not a context; team-held techs are read
  through the player) — the ctx carries no `CvTeam*`.
- **`CvPlotGroup` STAYS a first-class ctx member** — it is the reserved explicit traded-bonus source (§ the
  read, below), not a scope whose state a context owns.
- **`CvUnit` stays raw FOR NOW** — units are the deliberate FUTURE role-specific scope; when that context
  lands it replaces the pointer, and until then this is the one acknowledged hole, not a licence for others.
- **The enabler's precomputed sets** (operating/active/obsolete buildings, vicinity-provided bonuses) stay ctx
  members: they are the ENABLER's derived output fed to the evaluator, never per-scope live state.
- **⚖ THE SOURCE SLOTS — a predicate about the CARRIER needs the carrier named, because an entry cannot name
  itself.** Neither a compiled entry nor an info knows its own engine id, so a condition asking about the
  DEPOSITING entity rather than the target (`existedFor` — how long has THIS building stood) has no other way
  to ask. The ctx therefore carries a slot per such axis — `religion` (the §3.7 counted-kind filter),
  `sourceBuilding`, and `civic` (the `{CIVIC_CATEGORY}` predicate's carrier, set by the civic-upkeep resolve) —
  **set per-iteration by the walk that knows the id, on a LOCAL COPY of the ctx, and -1
  everywhere else**; the shared ctx is never mutated. ⛔ -1 means "no carrier in hand" and a source-predicate
  must answer FALSE there: a scope-wide read that never set it would otherwise resolve against whichever
  entity the walk happened to reach last.
  ⚠ **A source slot is only meaningful where the carrier is SINGULAR.** The city fold resolves one building at
  a time, so it sets one; the EMPIRE fold walks a building the player may hold N copies of, each acquired at a
  different moment, so the question has no single answer and the slot stays unset by design. That is a
  structural limit, not an unwired leg — do not "complete" it by setting the slot there.
- **A context that cannot answer a needed fact is a CONTEXT GAP to close** (add the forward), never a reason to
  re-add an object pointer. That is the forcing function the structural form buys.

**⚖ THE HAVE AXIS LIVES IN THE CONTEXTS (owner).** What a scope POSSESSES — the city's buildings-present /
religions / corporations / bonuses, the empire's civics / traits / heritages, the team-held techs (read through
the player's team — team is deliberately not a context) — is read through that scope's context, never by an
ad-hoc reach into the game object. The STORES-vs-FORWARDS discipline above is unchanged: possession state the
object already owns O(1) is FORWARDED, and only a homeless aggregate is stored (`policies` is the realized
exemplar). The context is the RESPONSIBILITY home — the one place every reader (the evaluator's atoms, the
enabler's gates, the `expected*` valuations) goes for HAVE. The enabler's DERIVED sets (the domain vectors, the
operating-building set) remain enabler-owned ([enabler.md §7](specs/enabler.md)); the contexts serve the raw
possession facts those machines gate against.

**⚖ IF IT IS CURRENT STATE, IT IS THE CONTEXT'S — there is no third home (owner).** A value that looks like it
needs a new category almost always just IS current state, and current state has one home. The worked case: the
city's **thresholds** (growth / culture / great-people — what is REQUIRED right now, moving with population,
gamespeed and era), its **turns-left** projections, and its cross-city **ranks** are none of them a new kind of
read — they are this city's state now, so they are asked of the context like every other state fact. The
STORES-vs-FORWARDS split then decides each one on its own merits (a value the object already computes O(1) is
FORWARDED; only a homeless aggregate is stored) — the classification is never "invent a shape for it".
⚠ **Ranks are the case that STRESSES the rule**, and stressing it is not breaking it: a rank is a comparison
ACROSS cities, so no single city owns the answer and a stored rank would need maintaining on every sibling's
change. Read it at the scope that can actually answer it — the player — rather than bending the city's context
around it.

### COUNTS, not objects — "how many, not which" (owner)

An aggregate holds **counts keyed by id**, never the objects themselves. A building cares HOW MANY river plots /
vicinity bonuses it has, never WHICH. So a `plots`-target (or keyed) deposit's output is `flat × count(id)`, and a
gate is `has(id)` (count > 0).

> **⚖ THAT PRODUCT IS A YIELD, AND THE DICTIONARY IS ONE OF ITS TWO OPERANDS (owner).** `Δ(flat × count) = flat ×

The stored aggregate rides events, exactly like the rest of the spine; a missed event drifts it, but that is the
event spine's **baseline invariant** (plot-groups and vicinity drift the same way if events are incomplete), not a
context-specific weakness. There is **no blanket per-turn rebuild** and no recompute-on-read.

⛔ **AND NOTHING HEALS A MISS — that is what makes incomplete wiring safe to grow (owner).** No periodic or per-turn
context refresh, no "rebuild if it looks stale", no lazy recompute-on-read when a store looks empty, no staleness-timer
sweep, no validity/epoch stamp that triggers re-derivation, and no "recompute once per turn to be safe" backstop —
not as a safety net, not transitionally, not "just for load". If a store ever seems to need a "make sure it's
current" call, that is a **missing fact to report**, never a recompute to add — the full reasoning (why a missing
emit is the failure that should survive) is § A SELF-HEAL IS THE
FOSSIL OF A MISSING EMIT, above ([self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban); CAPSTONE — LOAD is the only full build).

  itself, which applies each grantor's policy block as a DELTA — never a refill, which would recount every time
  and so hide the multi-grantor case the count exists for. It is the single
  source the one policy read (`ev_playerHasPolicy`) uses — reads never re-walk the grantors. The **player-init** fact
  is load-bearing on its own: a player's INITIAL traits are written straight into the has-array rather than through
  the trait setter, so that fact is the only announcement they ever make.
  ⛔ It is deliberately **not** maintained from `CvPlayer::setCivics` / `setHasTrait`: a direct hook beside an event
  is a second maintenance surface for one fact, and the fact already exists.
  ⚑ **This store is the ONE home of the per-flag policy verdicts** — the boolean getters (`isNoForeignTrade`,
  `isStateReligion`, `isInquisitionConditions` and their kin) read `has`, and the AI civic-value what-ifs read
  `count` with an unconditional vacuum subtraction of the option slot's own civic. The serialized per-flag
  counters `processCivics`/`processTrait` once pushed beside it were the second-surface class and are cut
  ([the uniform legacy-accumulator cut](#-the-legacy-accumulator-cut--every-accumulator-one-uniform-mechanism)); their changers' side-effect riders
  live at the adoption site (`setCivics`), diff-gated on the policy actually moving. Genuine non-cascade state
  on that same class (the revolution index, `changeMaxConscript`, `changeSpecialistValidCount`, hurry counts)
  stays serialized as-is.

- **AREAS are announced WHOLESALE.** `CvMap::recalculateAreas` clears every plot's area, empties the area list and
  recalculates, so it emits **`SEVT_AREAS_RECALCULATED`** (no payload — the fact IS "all of them") and every holder
  of an area id re-reads. Areas are virtually never recalculated (terrain levelled to sea level — the WMD mechanic —
  plus map generation), so the blanket costs nothing at its real frequency, and it is **not** the banned self-heal: a
  wholesale identity reassignment is not addressable per-source, so no finer route exists to derive
  ([self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban) bans papering over a MISSED invalidation, not announcing a
  genuine wholesale one).
- **Forwarded** fields need no maintenance — they read the live source.
- **Load** — `EmpireContext.policies` rebuilds from the **in-read civic/trait/player-init emits** as they stream (a
  derived aggregate recomputes from source on load, [derived data is never trusted from a save](specs/save.md#5-derived-data-serializes-nothing-),
  never trusted from a save) — through the consumer, not a second build mechanism beside the event stream.
  `CityContext`'s other blocks build once at `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED`, because each reads state that is only complete when
  the whole stream has ended (the areas deserialize after the plots). That single pass IS the load build — the only
  full build there is — after which the facts alone maintain them.
  ⚑ The VICINITY dictionaries, `onSite` included, are not among them: they seed through the ORDINARY membership
  route, because re-establishing each city's work area announces one `SEVT_PLOT_WORKABLE_BY_ADDED` per plot and the
  applier folds that tile's CURRENT bonus and served resource. One route, both jobs — no separate build pass to keep
  in step ([the load reseed](spine.md#5-the-load-reseed): never a second build mechanism beside the event stream).
  `CityContext.plotAttrs` builds from the in-read DOMAIN events
  ([the load reseed](spine.md#5-the-load-reseed)): each `CvPlot::read` announces its deserialized working-city
  fact (`SEVT_PLOT_WORKING_CITY_ADDED / _REMOVED` — the genuine read site emits), and `CityContext`'s own consumer
  BUFFERS the load bracket's membership facts and folds them through the one applier
  (`CvCity::onCityPlotChanged`) at `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED` — the cities stream AFTER the map, so the fold applies once
  after the stream ends (the [enabler §7.1](specs/enabler.md) order rule's second option, never the mixed form).
  ⚠ **The buffer is an ORDERING fact, not a staleness mechanism** — there is no city to fold into while the map
  streams. The per-bit facts need no such treatment and are simply dropped inside the bracket: by the drain every
  plot has announced its substrate, so the fold reads FINAL bits and applying them earlier would only count them
  twice. There is never a blanket per-turn recompute.

### Scope set — plot / city / player now; units FUTURE (role-specific); no AreaContext (owner)

Contexts exist today on **plot, city, and player**. There is deliberately **no `AreaContext`**, and the reason
generalizes: **an area is not a scope at all.** A scope must be unambiguously OWNABLE — universal (world) or
owned by exactly one player up the chain — and a landmass is shared by several empires at once, so anything on it
is a per-(landmass × player) cross-product rather than a scope
(§ THE READ PATH, below). An area is therefore a bare **id**, "a really big plot" to
reference, and an area-shaped effect authors at **empire**.

> **⛔ AND TEAM IS NOT A CONTEXT EITHER — `CvTeam` IS THE TECH BRIDGE; `CvPlayer` HOLDS THE CONTEXT (owner).**
> A team's job on this plane is to hold the shared TECH/war facts and hand them across its members. It owns no
> live-state surface, so **every team fact a reader needs is asked of the PLAYER** — team-held techs through
> `EmpireContext::teamHasTech`, and everything else forwarded the same way.
> ⇒ The team carries the unified TECH and PROJECT lists as MEMBERSHIP; anything DERIVED off them — the capability
> union, the skill planes — is the PLAYER's. A derived store landing on `CvTeam` is misplaced by construction,
> whatever maintains it.
> ⛔ **Consequence, and it is structural: `CvCascadeEvalCtx` carries NO `CvTeam*`**, and no getter, evaluator,
> predicate or valuation reaches a team to answer a state question. A player that cannot answer one is a
> **CONTEXT GAP to close by adding the forward** (§ THE EVAL CTX, above), never a reason to reach a team.
> ⚠ **Do NOT read the DEPOSIT spine as licence.** `world › team › empire › city › plot` is the containment spine
> for MAGNITUDES, and a team genuinely carries a package (§ THE READ PATH, below: three
> channels) — so "team is a scope" is true of deposits and false of state. Conflating the two is what puts a
> `CvTeam*` back in a reader's hands; the same distinction is stated on `CvTeam` itself.

⚑ **What the contexts DO carry is the area FACT** — the city's area id, its tile count and the coastal
water-body size, forwarded by `CityContext` for the `AREA_SIZE` token and the adjacency reads. *"We rather use
the area id"* (owner): the id is a fact a city reads, never a place state lives.

**Units are a deliberate FUTURE scope, held off on purpose (owner).** A unit context must be **ROLE-SPECIFIC**: the
goal is that a unit no longer carries ALL the data (the ~247-field fat-unit problem) — each unit holds only the state
its role needs. Working out that role-partitioning is *why* it waits, rather than wiring a fat unit context now.

**⚖ IDENTIFIED MEMBER — the UPGRADE resolution belongs to the UNIT CONTEXT (owner).** *"Upgrade should live in the
unit context."* **The DIRECTION is the ruling (owner): the UNIT asks.** *"When a unit asks if they can do their
upgrade in a city somewhere, then the unit has to check if a city has whatever requirement it needs."* This is
built: `CvUnit::getUpgradeCity` drives the search and fans out to `GET_PLAYER(...).cities()`, asking each
candidate's own `getUnitAvailability(eUnit)` — a city is a place the query LOOKS, never the owner of the
question.

⚑ **AND IT IS PURELY AN AI-LOOP CONCERN (owner)** — the AI deciding whether, and where, to send a unit to
upgrade. That settles its cost class: any caching this resolution earns is **AI-heuristic caching**, the
sanctioned residual ([superseded-ideas #1](architecture/superseded-ideas.md)), NOT engine state and NOT a derived cache on
the cascade plane — it would carry no staleness protocol and answer to no invalidation contract.

An info's ACTUAL contextual output is read **one endpoint per GROUP of channels** (owner), never per single channel:
`expectedFlatYields` / `expectedYieldModifiers` / `expectedPlotYields` / `expectedFlatCommerce` / `expectedWellbeing`.
Each takes the three live contexts and fills that group's ×100 array — **you pass the contexts in, you get the group's
expected values out**: `(CityContext, EmpireContext, CvPlotGroup)` → the group's values.

- **CityContext** — vicinity + local state AND the river/water/… plot-attr COUNTS (`plotAttrs`). A building reads the
  CITY context for "how many river tiles", **never a PlotContext directly** (owner) — the plot-count sums live in the
  city context. It also answers the city's **traded** bonuses (through the city's own plot-group-backed reads).
- **EmpireContext** — the empire-scope state (civics/traits/policies/state religion).
- **CvPlotGroup** — the trade-network object; the reserved explicit **traded**-bonus source (`connection:"trade"` vs
  `"vicinity"`, [json.md §3.4](specs/json.md)). Traded state is **NEVER mirrored into `CityContext`**. The
  valuation seam fills it into the eval ctx (`CvCascadeEvalCtx::plotGroup`): a `connection:"trade"` atom reads the
  city's own plot-group-backed RELAY when a city is bound (`CityContext::tradedBonusCount` forwards to
  `CvCity::getNumBonuses` — the tech-gate/minted/corp layer over the group's count), and the passed group directly
  for the city-less what-if.

Each endpoint returns the UNCONDITIONED ×100 base PLUS every conditioned `m_cond` deposit whose condition holds — summed
via the **one** evaluator (`MMKernel::applies`) over a `CvCascadeEvalCtx` the contexts fill (`CityContext::fillEvalCtx`
= city/plot, `EmpireContext::fillEvalCtx` = player/team) — so the contexts ARE the eval state, not a raw-pointer ctx
built beside them. `expectedPlotYields` scales each plots-target deposit by `cityContext.plotAttrs.count(predicate)`.

> **Everything an info holds is ×100** ([the ×100 fixed-point model](specs/curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries)) — readJson converts
> human→×100 once at load; the info never de-scales; a reader `÷100`s at the point of use. So these endpoints add
> `value100` directly, and the materialized base members are `value100`.

> **Naming — no abbreviated parameters (owner).** Parameters are spelled in full (`cityContext`, `empireContext`,
> `plotGroup`), never `cx`/`pg`: short names are only defensible inside a tightly-scoped lambda, which C++03 lacks.
> Index parameters likewise name the enum they key (`YieldTypes eYield`, `DefenseKind eKind`), reusing the
> existing engine + family enums — a new family mints one typed enum, and the group's entries + its `expected*`
> array both key off it ([patterns.md § THE GETTER SETUP](architecture/patterns.md)).

### ⚖ THE READ PATH — THE CASCADE PROVIDES, THE GAME OBJECT SUMS (owner, LOCKED)

- **The cascade is the PACKAGE STORE, nothing more.** Per `(scope × channel × combine-position)` it holds one
  standing sum — how a yield is influenced, and by how much, from every source. It answers *what influences
  this*, and it **never computes a final number**.
- **The GAME OBJECT sums.** The consuming object fetches the packages it sits under and applies its channel's
  combine formula. That arithmetic is the object's, not the store's.
- **ONE reporting surface, read identically by both consumers** — the game object summing, and the endpoints
  decomposing — so the number a city computes and the breakdown an endpoint renders are the SAME bytes. Two
  surfaces would be two derivations, and they would drift.

  Plot and the upper scopes are therefore mirror images (yield-only vs percent-only), and **CITY is the single
  scope carrying both**. That is why "whether a scope's packages are empty is irrelevant" is not hand-waving: the
  shape is uniform, and the origin rule says which half any given scope ever fills.
  ⚖ **The rule governs the YIELD/RATE plane; for every other family the sides are the DATA's and the minted
  channel sets enforce them** (wellbeing authors empire flats; health/defense/property author plot percents)
  — §1. ⛔ Consequence for any read-side roll-up: **the channel set is the
  gate, never a hand-written per-scope filter.**

  **⛔ THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENT (owner): every modifier/yield cache is ONE shape** — one flats dictionary
  per YIELD ORIGIN the scope carries plus one percents dictionary, each an int keyed by channel. Every scope but
  CITY carries a single flats dictionary, because only the city has more than one yield origin (below). The
  requirement is SAMENESS OF SHAPE, never a count of dictionaries: what is banned is a bespoke struct or a
  hand-named field, not a second dictionary of the same uniform type distinguished by its origin. The drift it replaces is the ~33
  hand-named scalar fields (`scGpBaseBld`, `scDefense`, `scDefBombard`, `scMaintModCity`, `scTradeCity`,
  `brCityMilitary`, …): a hand-named field cannot be addressed uniformly, so it forces a bespoke invalidation
  path per field, which is how that many accumulated. A new scope or channel must be DATA, not a new struct.

  **⛔ KEYS ONLY WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED (owner) — the storage is NOT a global dense index.** The channel set is
  DATA-DEFINED (`PROPERTY_*` is one channel per property info) and no object uses more than a fraction of it, so
  a dense array over every channel on every object is mostly zeros — on 9,600 plots that is ~7 MB of nothing.
  Each scope carries ONLY the channels authored AT that scope, both the channel ids and the per-scope sets
  derived from the data at load (the `ClassificationRegistry` minting precedent), never hand-listed. The
  layout is OPEN-ENDED: slot indices are append-only ints with no fixed bit budget, so the per-scope counts
  grow with the authored data — read them off the load's `[MODIFIER]` channel-census line
  (`Cascade.log`, one line per scope: authored / slots / receivers), never from a remembered figure.

  **⛔ A SCOPE MUST BE UNAMBIGUOUSLY OWNABLE — WHICH IS WHY A LANDMASS IS NOT ONE (owner).** This is the test a
  candidate scope has to pass, and it explains the whole spine at once:
  - **WORLD passes by being UNIVERSAL** — *"game scope works, because it affects everyone, always"*, so the
    question of who owns the value never arises.
  - **team / empire / city / plot pass by being OWNED BY EXACTLY ONE PLAYER** up the chain, which is what lets a
    deposit roll DOWN and a target read one combined total.
  - **A LANDMASS passes NEITHER.** *"It knows no borders"* — one landmass spans several empires at once, so an
    effect on it *"affects individual players"* and is inherently a per-(landmass × player) **CROSS-PRODUCT**
    rather than a scope. Modelling it as one forces a bespoke slot into the MIDDLE of the containment spine, and
    that bespoke slot is the TELL, not the solution.

  So **there is no area scope**: `"area"` is not a scope token, no object carries an area package, and the
  containment spine is `world › team › empire › city › plot` ([json.md §3.2](specs/json.md)). The legacy
  `iArea*` authorings were modders reading "area" as "player" — they author at **EMPIRE** — and the ONE genuine
  area concept is a PHYSICAL CONTIGUITY constraint (you cannot run power lines across an ocean), which is the
  engine-side clean-power counter and never a cascade channel.
  ⚑ **The area ID SURVIVES as a plain FACT**, and that is the whole of what an area is to the cascade: a bare id
  plus its tile count, forwarded by `CityContext` for the `AREA_SIZE` token and the coastal water-body read
  (§ THE CONTEXTS, above). ⛔ The city carries that ID, never a `CvArea*` or a per-read `area()` chase — a
  per-read `area()->getNumTiles()` dereferences a whole object to answer a counter an int already holds.
  **⚑ Areas are VIRTUALLY NEVER recalculated (owner)** — `CvMap::recalculateAreas` exists for the extreme case
  of terrain levelled to sea level (the WMD mechanic), plus map generation; a landmass does not otherwise split
  or merge in play. Treat a rebuild as RARE-but-real: it does `m_areas.removeAll()` and reassigns every id.
  **So the rebuild announces itself as a DOMAIN fact (owner): emit "areas recalculated" and force the recheck** —
  every holder of an area id re-reads, rather than each cache inventing its own staleness test. Being rare, the
  blanket costs nothing; and it is not the banned self-heal: a wholesale identity reassignment is not
  addressable per-source, so no finer route exists to derive ([self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban)
  bans papering over a
  MISSED invalidation, not announcing a genuine wholesale one).

  **⛔ TWO SCOPES ARE DELIBERATELY NOT PACKAGES (owner):**
  - **WORLD is CONFIG** — cost multipliers and the like, carried by eras / gamespeeds / handicaps. It changes
    essentially never and is read from its sources, not cached behind a staleness protocol. A project granting
    something to every player is NOT world-scope state: it authors the plural TARGET `world.empires`
    ([json.md §3.3](specs/json.md)) and lands in each PLAYER's package. The handful of `health.world` /
    `happiness.world` / `tradeRoutes.world` project authorings are mis-scoped data, a curator fix
    ([recurate on every decision](../AGENTS.md#git--delivery)).
  - **UNIT is RESOLVED VALUES, not a package** — "when the number is put on the unit, no more percentages or
    whatever is involved, the data just IS". The exact set of numbers a unit carries is known, so they are summed
    and stored individually, and they move on a different trigger from everything else: ONLY when a promotion or
    combat class changes — plus ONE seeding gather at BIRTH (`SEVT_UNIT_CREATED` at play; the END of the unit's
    own `read()` at load, the one point its full held set has streamed in — the consumer's mark cannot serve a
    loaded unit, since its getUnit lookup runs while the player's unit list is still mid-stream), because the
    non-delta slots (vision above all) carry the unit's own BASE: a unit holding no promotion and no extra
    combat class would otherwise never gather and read 0. It is the most static plane in the engine.
    ⛔ **THE SUM WALKS WHAT THE UNIT HOLDS, NEVER THE REGISTRY.** The contributors are the unit's own type plus
    its held promotions and held combat classes, enumerated from the containers the unit already keys them in —
    not discovered by sweeping every promotion and every class asking "do I have this?". That sweep costs the
    DATABASE per gather to rediscover a handful, which is the O(registry) shape the event-built state exists to
    delete (§ THE CONTEXTS, above: a read that walks per call is the efficiency defect to reject in review)
    and the own-data inversion [reverse lookups are populated once, at load](#1-one-step-deposit-down-accumulate-read-o1) bans one plane over.
    The unit's storage is therefore NOT a
    bespoke struct awaiting consolidation — it is correctly its own shape, and the 12 unit-only families
    (`strength`, `movement`, `withdrawal`, `firstStrike`, `capture`, `collateral`, `heal`, `bombard`, `air`,
    `cargo`, `range`, `pillage`, …) never enter a scope's channel set.
    ⚖ **STRENGTH'S BASE IS PER-UNIT STATE AND IS DELIBERATELY SERIALIZED (owner ruling).** Every other resolved
    slot takes the unit's own TYPE from the gather, because it is a pure function of that type. Base strength is
    not: **WorldBuilder edits an individual unit's strength**, and the WBS scenario format persists the result
    (`CombatStr=`, written only when it differs from the type). *"You want people to be able to do things in
    WorldBuilder."* So the base lives on `CvUnit` as the serialized `m_iBaseCombat`, the resolved plane carries
    the promotion / unit-combat **DELTA ONLY**, and the consumer adds the two. ⛔ This is the ONE carve-out in an
    otherwise uniform gather, and it is load-bearing: letting the type contribute to the strength slot as well
    silently DOUBLE-COUNTS every unit's authored base. ⚠ It is therefore NOT a
    [derived data is never trusted from a save](specs/save.md#5-derived-data-serializes-nothing-) violation — the value is genuine
    per-unit state that no amount of re-derivation can reconstruct, which is exactly why it is stored.
    ⛔ **AND A SECOND ONE IS NOT ADMITTED: AN INVISIBLE ADDITION TO A BASE STAT IS BAD DESIGN WHICHEVER WAY
    YOU PUT IT (owner).** A per-unit stat change is expressed as a CARRIER — a promotion or a status — *"so you
    actually see what is going on with the unit and why"*, which is also why the gather walks the carriers it
    does: each is visible on the unit. ⇒ A mechanic that would force a second carve-out is the MECHANIC that
    goes — an event handing one unit a stat outright is source-less one-shot state, and *"I would be inclined
    to nuke such an event."* ⚠ It has no claim anyway: its only delivery is a promotion
    ([state.md](specs/state.md)), which is already what serializes.
    ⚖ **A NEW SPECIAL CASE SHIPS WITH THE MEANS TO SHOW IT, OR IT IS NOT ADDED (owner): *"if we want to
    support special casing, we also need to support the ability to show it — so if we want to add that in the
    WorldBuilder, then we need to create tooling for it."***
    ⛔ **STRENGTH ITSELF STAYS FOR NOW AND IS NOT TO BE TOUCHED — it works (owner)**: illegible in exactly the
    way this dislikes, and knowingly kept, so an agent "fixing" it is undoing a decision rather than closing a
    gap. ⚖ It is NOT permanent — **when a real pass at WorldBuilder special-case additions is taken, strength
    folds into it** (owner): sequencing with a named destination, so
    ["deferred" is banned](../AGENTS.md#design) does not reach it. ⛔ Do not start that fold early or take
    it opportunistically.
    ⚖ **A SECTION FOLDS BESIDE THE SLOT TABLE, ON THE SAME MARK — it does not become a slot, and it does not
    become a hand-named pair either.** The slot table addresses modifier-FAMILY entries by
    `(family, kind, scope, unit)`; a `hideAndSeek`-shaped SECTION ([json.md §9](specs/json.md)) has no such
    address, so it cannot ride the table — and a scalar pair beside it would be the shape
    [every derived cache is one shape](#-every-derived-store-is-one-shape--a-keyed-accumulator-maintained-by-a-delta-owner) calls a defect. It gets its own cached block
    on the SAME two facts, so ONE route maintains one unit's whole resolved state.
    ⚑ **What earns a section that block is the CARRIER SET, and it is the test to apply to the next one:** it
    folds over exactly the unit's own info ∪ held promotions ∪ held unit-combat classes — the same three the slot
    table folds over — so the two facts that move the table are precisely the two that move it, with no third
    trigger to find. ⛔ A per-read fold over those carriers is the O(registry) walk this plane exists to delete,
    and converting it to walk the HELD containers instead is NOT the fix — that is the same walk with a better
    receiver (§ THE CONTEXTS, above). The read becomes a bare fetch or nothing has been done.
  ⚠ Hand-maintained duplicates DRIFT — that is not theoretical: the maintenance decomposition and its cached fill
  duplicated five terms, and the L8 home/otherArea overlay landed in one and not the other, so `/computed`
  under-reported by 39 against the served value until the duplicate was replaced by a delegation.
  Full rebuild of everything = LOAD ONLY.
  **⛔ THE FIX IS NEVER "ADD ANOTHER STRUCT" — that is the failure mode this ruling exists to close.** The previous
  substrate grew ONE BESPOKE STRUCT PER SCOPE, each with hand-named per-channel members instead of channel-indexed
  Σflat/Σpercent; it is archived and must not be reconstructed ([superseded-ideas](architecture/superseded-ideas.md) #14).
  **A missing scope is a SYMPTOM of that, not the disease:** with one uniform package, giving a scope its packages
  is a single member; with bespoke structs every scope is its own project — which is exactly why a small scope
  (team, at three channels) never got one, and why its sums leaked into whichever neighbour already had
  a struct. So the package TYPE is unified FIRST (one owner-templated, channel-indexed package on
  `CvDerivedCacheSet<TOwner>`), after which every scope falls out of the same member. Adding a further per-scope
  struct deepens the divergence this closes.

### ⚖ THE CAPSTONE RULE: the cascade is built and kept current ENTIRELY from events — no blanket rebuild, ever, and no per-slot rebuild either

On LOAD the cascade is stood up by the **event reseed** — the save read fires
the DOMAIN events for every fact as it deserializes and each fact applies its source's deposits
([spine.md](spine.md) / [the load reseed](spine.md#5-the-load-reseed)); the old
recompute-on-load / warm-up recalc (`playerSliceRebuild` + `worldRebuild`) was a stabilize-the-drift STOPGAP
and is REMOVED. Post-load, a fact reaches exactly the slots its deposits feed and **nothing else runs at all** —
no full per-player rebuild on `doTurn`, no mark-all, no per-slice blanket, no turn-roll self-heal
([self-heal is not a backstop](#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban)). A missed emit surfaces as a live divergence, never a
silently self-healed cost — which is precisely why the event spine must be COMPLETE (every mutation emits) and
is built proper and FIRST.
⚑ **Under the maintained sum that sentence hardens from a design preference into a PRECONDITION:** an
unsaturated spine does not merely leave a value stale, it leaves the sum wrong with nothing that could ever
correct it ([the maintained sum](#-the-maintained-sum--three-planes-one-slot-and-nothing-is-ever-recomputed)).
Reads are BARE NUMBER FETCHES during the turn (an ensure-per-read protocol on AI-hot paths measurably ground
unit automation). ⚑ *"It's the percentage recalcs that hurt"* is answered at the root rather than mitigated:
the compiled deposit carries its channel AND its unit, so a flat fact touches a flat slot and no percent stack
is ever walked — there is no mask to split, because there is no recalc to narrow.

### ⚖ THE PER-SCOPE PACKAGE MODEL — the cascade's founding design (§1), stated as cache architecture

A package lives ON EVERY SCOPED ITEM, every level (world → team → player
→ city → plot); the cascade loads **yield packages in ONE UNIFORM FORMAT** (Σflat and Σpercent each their OWN
package per channel; the unit is part of the slot key) into each scope's cache; each package is maintained
from events at its OWN scope (a world-scope fact moves the world package while every other level stands). **The
only live calculation is adding the ~5 packages together at read.**

⛔ **AND THE ORIGIN RULE'S EXTENDED FORM (owner) — CITY ITSELF SPLITS INTO THREE PACKAGES, NOT ONE:** *"a city's
yields are based on 3 packages, the yields from plots, the yields from specialists, and yields from buildings,
that is 3 separate packages."* The plot origin is the per-plot package summed over the city's worked plots; the
SPECIALIST and BUILDING origins are two distinct flat packages ON THE CITY.
⚑ **This is forced, not stylistic.** §2a puts specialists in TIER 1
(inside the percent stack) and buildings in TIER 2 (added after it), and § THE MAINTAINED SUM bans a
per-source decomposition — so once both origins land in ONE Σ slot the two tiers can never be separated
again. A single city flat package therefore cannot express the rate at all.
⛔ **The failure it produces, which is the reason this is spelled out:** the specialist half gets recovered
by a hand-walk over the city's specialists at read time, and the SAME authored deposit is then counted twice —
once inside the stack and once outside it. That walk is also the O(what EXISTS) read-time shape this whole
document deletes; a maintained specialist package needs no walk at all.
⛔ **ENFORCED BY TYPE, NEVER BY CONVENTION** ([the hard-typing-or-rollerskate rule](../AGENTS.md#design)):
the two planes are DIFFERENT TYPES (the package template carries its ORIGIN), so a specialist deposit reaching
the building plane does not compile. A comment saying which package a source belongs in is exactly what has
been re-corrected repeatedly and does not hold.

MODIFIERS still come from everything BUT plot — city, empire, team, world. So the percent side exists at
every scope except plot, and it is ONE dictionary: percents combine into a single additive stack
(§2a), so they have no origin to keep apart.

**⛔ THE GENERAL FORM — PACKAGE IDENTITY IS `(scope × COMBINE POSITION × channel)`.** Origin is the yield
plane's instance of a wider law: within a scope, packages stay isolated **per combine position** and never
merge into one per-scope number. The city's yield positions are the two-then-three origins above; every channel
family defines its own positions (wellbeing's opposing channels, the scalar stacks), and a scope's packages
follow that channel's positions. ⛔ A per-scope blob is the defect — whatever is summed together can never be
told apart again, and the combine is what needs them apart.

**⛔ THE FOUR-PROVIDER LAW — only PLOTS, SPECIALISTS, BUILDINGS and TRADE ROUTES provide yield.** They are
what physically produces yield in game. Every other source kind — trait, civic, tech, religion, corporation —
only MODIFIES or CONDITIONS a provider's output, so **every yield deposit resolves onto a PROVIDER-KIND
package**: a trait's specialist boost lands on the SPECIALIST package, a civic's building-keyed percent on the
BUILDING percent stack. ⚑ This is what decides which package a deposit joins, and therefore which leg the
percent stack multiplies — the question the origin split exists to answer.
**⚖ FOUR PROVIDERS, THREE PACKAGES — the TRADE ROUTE is a provider that is NOT a package (owner): *"trade
route yields are always provided by the ENGINE; the trade route buffs happen BEFORE it arrives, as its
complete package."*** The engine owns the network calculation and applies the route's own buffs, so the
cascade receives a FINISHED value and folds it at the combine — it is the one live yield INPUT, never derived
(§2a). ⛔ **So no trade-route package exists and none is to be built.**
Nothing deposits into it: a package with no depositors is an empty slot inviting a future deposit to be routed
somewhere the engine already answered, which would double the route's yield.
⚑ **WHAT THE CASCADE OWNS IS THE COUNT, AND ONLY THE COUNT (owner): *"we only tell the engine how many trade
routes we can have."*** The `tradeRoutes` channel — how many routes a city may run — is cascade-computed like
any other modifier-influenced value; the YIELD those routes then produce is entirely the engine's.
⛔ **Do not conflate them** (§2a states this at length and is the
authority). ⚠ The trap is one-directional and worth naming: listing trade routes among the PROVIDERS reads as
licence to give them a package, because the other three have one. They are a provider of yield and a consumer
of a cascade COUNT — never a home for deposits.
⚖ **The golden-age and free-city TRAIT FLATS need no provider home (owner):** they are plain flat bonuses
riding the flat yield packages outside the provider chain, joining BASE at the combine. Golden age is a core
engine mechanic and stays simple. ⚠ "free-city" is the trait yield accumulator, NOT the WLTKD celebration.

**⚖ THE CITY-REALIZATION LAW — a deposit whose CONDITION references the CITY is a city-realized join,
whatever its authored scope.** State-religion-in-city, a city building's presence, any city predicate:
evaluating such a deposit once at PLAYER scope resolves it against one city's context and mis-serves every
other city. So all conditioned percent stacks realize PER CITY, in the city's package, against that city's
own context; the player scope holds only the genuinely city-AGNOSTIC sums. ⚠ Measured, not theoretical: the
player-scope evaluation left persistent +18..+27 percent errors on every non-capital city.

- **⚖ THE KEY IS SAMENESS (owner ruling): every store is the SAME OBJECT TYPE everywhere, and they ALL MAINTAIN
  the SAME WAY.** That — not the per-scope layout — is the requirement the whole model rests on. One templated
  channel-indexed slot table on every owner, and ONE application path driving all of it, derived from the deposit
  index. What varies between scopes is only WHICH SLOTS carry a value; the type and the protocol never vary.
  - **A RECEIVER IS NOT A STORED SLOT AT ALL WHERE IT SUMS MEMBERS (owner).** A scope that consumes a channel
    from BELOW it — the empire's research / gold / culture / espionage over its cities — answers by summing its
    members' realized values at the read (§ A CROSS-SCOPE RECEIVER TOTAL, above). There is no "receiver mechanism" to
    build, and that is because there is no receiver STORE, not because one is shared.
    ⚠ Do not read the city's own realized rate as an instance of this: a city consuming production is combining
    ITS OWN packages, not summing members, so it is an ordinary package read and no member count enters it.
  - **⛔ THIS IS WHY HAND-NAMED SCALAR FIELDS ARE THE DEFECT, not just untidy.** A named field cannot be addressed
    uniformly, so it forces its own bespoke maintenance path — which is precisely how 33 of them accumulated.
    Channel-indexed slots are reached by the deposit's own compiled address, with no per-field code.
  - **The receiving scope is NOT the storing scope.** A package never moves to its consumer (that breaks the scope
    principle); the consumer SUMS its members at the read and stores nothing.
  - **⛔ A CROSS-SCOPE receiver total is the Σ of its MEMBERS' REALIZED values — and NOTHING beside that Σ.** The
    empire's gold / research / culture / espionage sums are Σ over the player's cities of each city's realized
    rate of that channel, re-summed at the read. The
    per-city quantity for a commerce channel is the whole §2a split — the
    slider share of the city's COMMERCE yield, the channel's own deposits, and the process conversion — not the
    channel's deposits alone. ⛔ **An upper scope's own package is NEVER added on top of that Σ:** its deposits
    roll DOWN (§1) and are therefore already inside every member's realized
    value, so adding them again at the receiving scope counts each empire-scope deposit once per city PLUS once
    more — a silent multiplication that compiles, runs, and simply reports wrong numbers.
  - **⛔ NOT a push accumulator, and NOT a per-CANDIDATE ask** (§ A CROSS-SCOPE RECEIVER TOTAL, above: the cost is
    the member count, the cadence is the only defect). Rejecting the legacy incremental accumulator does not
    license an AI loop asking the Σ per candidate in a scoring pass: that caller hoists it once per pass into its
    own scratch (the sanctioned AI-heuristic residual), never a stored slot on the machine.
  - **⚖ THE CROSS-SCOPE RECEIVER — SUPPRESSION IS SETTLED; ONLY THE DELTA QUESTION IS OPEN.** A receiver total is
    the Σ of its members' **REALIZED** values (§ A CROSS-SCOPE receiver total, above), and a realized value is the §2a
    combine over the member's packages, not a stored deposit sum. Two of its apparent obstacles dissolve:
    - **⛔ DISORDER AND WLTKD ARE NOT TERMS IN THE COMBINE — they are a PARTICIPATION GATE ON THE Σ (owner):**
      *"disorder is easy, it just means that the packages that the city under disorder is simply not sent."* The
      city's stored value stays the real one and the sum declines to take it
      ([economy.md](reference/economy.md): *"the package is sent out to the rest of the cascade only if no
      status negates it"*).
    - **⛔ THE GATE BELONGS AT THE Σ, NOT ON A MAINTAINED MEMBERSHIP DELTA — and the reason is already ruled.**
      WLTKD is a ONE-TURN status re-applied every turn by its trigger ([state.md](specs/state.md)), so
      maintaining participation as a delta would flip a member in and out of the Σ every single turn *over a
      number that never moved* — precisely the thrash [economy.md](reference/economy.md) refuses to mark on
      (*"it suppresses the CONSUMPTION of the value, never its contents — so neither is a cache input and neither
      marks it"*). The filter therefore runs where the participation question is actually asked: at the sum.
    **⚖ THE RECEIVER RE-SUMS ITS PARTICIPATING MEMBERS, AND NOTHING IS BUILT TO AVOID THAT (owner).** *"The
    summing is so trivial that it would cost more to try some efficiency shenanigans."* The read side is ~5 int
    adds for the cross-scope roll-up and one combine per participating member for a receiver Σ — against the
    per-source walk the maintained sum deletes, that is not a cost to design around.
    ⛔ **So do NOT build a per-source decomposition plane.** A `(scope × channel × SOURCE)` breakdown exists only
    to make WITHDRAWAL cheap, and withdrawal is only expensive if summing is. Its source axis dwarfs the channel
    axis that KEYS ONLY WHERE NEEDED (above) already rejected as mostly-zeros, and the shape is the
    add-another-struct failure [every derived cache is one shape](#-every-derived-store-is-one-shape--a-keyed-accumulator-maintained-by-a-delta-owner) names. The
    unconditioned plane re-applies its compiled constant; the conditioned tail re-resolves; nothing stores a
    per-source breakdown.
    ⛔ **And do NOT push the realized delta upward** — that is the shenanigan the triviality makes pointless, and
    it is a push up the chain. The third shape is barred outright: a member EMITTING *"my realized value
    changed"* ([spine.md](spine.md): *"yield is a computed RESULT, never an event"*).
    > **⚑ THIS IS NOT A DEFERRAL, and reading it as one is the misreading to prevent (owner): *"IF it shows that
    > the summing requires any kind of serious power, we deal with it then."*** ["deferred" is banned](../AGENTS.md#design)

  - **Which scope receives a channel is spec'd, not chosen per site:** one consuming scope per channel
    (food/production → city; gold/research/espionage/**maintenance** → empire), with **culture the lone
    dual-consumer** (the city sums it for plot culture + border expansion, the empire for civ culture + traits —
    two independent sums over the same packages).
    ⚑ **MAINTENANCE is the one NON-commerce receiver, and it is what makes the rule general rather than a
    commerce habit.** The empire's total maintenance is the Σ over its cities of each city's realized
    maintenance — precisely the cross-scope receiver shape above — re-summed at the read like its commerce
    siblings, never a hand-named cache beside the packages
    ([every derived cache is one shape](#-every-derived-store-is-one-shape--a-keyed-accumulator-maintained-by-a-delta-owner)).
    ⚠ Its per-city quantity is the one a package cannot answer alone: a city's realized maintenance composes the
    three component KINDS (distance / numCities / colony) each against its own modifiers, takes the `amount`
    stack over the total, and declines wholesale under WLTKD/disorder ([economy.md](reference/economy.md)).
    ⛔ **`MAINTENANCE_CORPORATION` is NOT one of them** — corporate maintenance is its own pre-inflation expense
    beside total maintenance, so the city total SKIPS that kind. Its deposit is a city-scope FLAT and therefore
    sits in the city's package like any other: a read that folded every maintenance kind would charge the same
    corporate gold twice in one expense total, plausibly and silently. So the Σ asks the CITY for its realized value —
    which is what "the Σ of its members' REALIZED values" already says.
    ⚠ **A receiver read is therefore NOT interchangeable with a rolled-legs read on the same channel.** The
    cross-scope roll-up answers a receiver channel with its maintained SUM, so a consumer that wants the
    channel's percent STACK at that scope must read the legs directly — asking the roll-up would hand back the
    realized total instead, silently and plausibly.
- **⚖ THE TWO DERIVED PLANES SHARE ONE MECHANISM — what differs is their CONTENT, never their maintenance:**
  - **The yield + percent packages** are maintained by applying the moved source's deposits to the slot they
    feed — § THE MAINTAINED SUM. ⛔ The earlier framing called this "an INPUT/OUTPUT value cache: memoize,
    mark-invalidate on a source event, recompute from inputs" and pointed it at `CvDerivedCache`. That framing
    is RETIRED, and it is what let the modifier alone keep a staleness protocol while both of its siblings ran
    without one ([superseded-ideas](architecture/superseded-ideas.md) #30).
  - **The ENABLER's sets (the frontier + the operating-building set)** are maintained by **TARGETED
    PROPAGATION**: each HAVE-change ripples through the **affected subset only** (re-check the affected
    candidates / ripple the fixpoint), updating the authoritative dataset **in place** via the reverse-index
    ([enabler.md](specs/enabler.md) §7). NEVER blanket-recomputed, NEVER a parallel shadow-delta.
  - ⚑ **So the honest difference is what a slot HOLDS** — refcounted set MEMBERSHIP versus a summed MAGNITUDE —
    and each is maintained in place by the fact that moved it. ⚠ That is why the enabler was able to run without
    a staleness protocol from the start, and it is the model the packages now match rather than the exception they
    were measured against.
  ⛔ Blanket-recomputing the whole operating-building fixpoint for every city on every event runs the enabler's set AS an
  input/output cache — **"burning down the library of Alexandria" (DESPAIR_INDEX #2)**. The fix is targeted
  propagation, the shape the frontier ALREADY uses (`onBuildingChanged` / `recheckHave` off the reverse-index). It
  is likewise **not a given** the yield-package shape fits any OTHER non-package channel (the unit plane,
  properties); each is decided per-channel, only AFTER the spec is fully in place.
- **⛔ THERE IS NO BATCHED TURN-END REBUILD PASS, AND NONE IS TO BE BUILT.** A "flags all turn, one unified
  rebuild at turn end, in dependency order" phase is the recompute model wearing a better cadence — it presumes
  a rebuild exists to schedule. Under the maintained sum there is nothing to batch: the slot was already correct
  when the fact arrived ([superseded-ideas](architecture/superseded-ideas.md) #30).
- **THE APPLICATION IS DERIVED FROM THE DATA, never hand-wired.** A DOMAIN event carries its SOURCE; the source's
  compiled deposits (the load-time strings→ints index, `Data/CvDepositIndex.{h,cpp}` — per-deposit interned
  segments + FK-resolved target id + the resolved channel/scope slot, compiled at readJson push-time) name exactly
  the channels × scopes × targets it feeds — **so what to apply, and where, falls out of the deposit addresses.**
  The routing is a pure function of the index; a hand-coded hook per event site is a per-site bespoke path of
  exactly the kind [every derived cache is one shape](#-every-derived-store-is-one-shape--a-keyed-accumulator-maintained-by-a-delta-owner) forbids. Derive it from the
  index.
- **Mid-turn read freshness: the per-player-slice SNAPSHOT** — *"getting a yield event in the middle of a turn is
  not retroactive; start of next turn is what is expected"*. A newly-founded city is the one ruled exception (it
  must read correct values the turn it exists, so its packages build eagerly at creation rather than waiting for
  the next slice).
- **EAGERLY BUILD ALL CACHES AT LOAD — the general policy stands.** *"I am happy to add even MINUTES to load time
  in order to have caches eagerly built on load in general."* ALL caches are warmed at load: a game-object's own
  derived cache (the plot-yield cache) eagerly from that object's own state, and the **cascade** eagerly by the
  **event reseed** — the spine fires every present-fact, so the cache-build/invalidation consumer populates every
  cascade package and turn 1 runs warm. What changed is ONLY the cascade's population MECHANISM: the
  recompute-from-state recalc (`playerSliceRebuild` + `worldRebuild`) is REMOVED (the CAPSTONE above); the eventspine
  reseed replaces it. No design ever serializes a derived value to save load time. **The perf LAW: "the name of any
  game in this town will always be TURN TIMES — if game load takes 50% longer it matters nothing if we can shave
  5-10-15% on turn time, because there is only 1 game load, but many many many turns."** Turn time is the objective
  EVERY perf decision optimizes; load time is the currency that pays for it. Ledgered as
  [turn time is king](#-the-per-scope-package-model--the-cascades-founding-design-1-stated-as-cache-architecture).

## 3. Conditioning — re-applied when its own dependency moves (the dormancy model)

A deposit may carry `enabled` / `disabled` / `per` ([json](specs/json.md) §3.7, §3.9). A deposit's condition uses the
**same vocabulary** as the enabler's `requires` — the same `all`/`any`/`noneOf` tree over the same atoms and
predicates — so a conditioned deposit is, in essence, **a `requires`-shaped gate with an output attached**: the
enabler resolves that shape to *availability* ("can I?"), the modifier resolves the *same* shape to a *magnitude*
("how much?").

> **⛔ A condition is a PREDICATE, never a bespoke sub-scope MEMBER ([conditions are predicates, never bespoke members](specs/json.md#35-predicates--a-systems-runtime-state-query)).**
> A deposit that applies only under some game state carries that state as a **predicate** in its `enabled`/`disabled`
> (or a `per`/`unit:` scaler, [json](specs/json.md) §3.7), at the deposit's normal scope — `{family}.empire.percent` +
> `enabled:"IS_CAPITAL"`, never a bespoke `{family}.empire.capital.percent` member. Encoding the condition as a new
> member instead *changes the core structure* — the kraken way. Full ruling, the extensible predicate registry, and
> the golden-age exception (`empire.goldenAge` — a PERMANENT engine member-mirror): [json](specs/json.md) §3.5.

**But they are SEPARATE FIELDS, not one condition** — because a thing can **require one condition yet gate its
effect (a buff *or* a nerf) on another**: a Forge `requires` connected iron to *operate*, but its +1 happiness is
`enabled` by *power*, not iron — and the magnitude can equally be negative (e.g. −production while polluted). So
the entity carries its `requires` once (whole-entity availability — the [enabler](specs/enabler.md)'s job), and each
deposit carries its **own** `enabled`/`disabled` (does *this effect* apply). Same condition language, two
independent fields.

**⛔ NOTHING IS RE-CHECKED ON A RECOMPUTE, BECAUSE THERE IS NO RECOMPUTE.** A conditioned deposit is applied
`±value` by **the ATOM's own verdict crossing**, and a `per`-scaled one by `±value × Δcount` from **the COUNT's
own fact** — the two routed planes of the maintained sum
(§ THE MAINTAINED SUM, above;
[the maintained sum](#-the-maintained-sum--three-planes-one-slot-and-nothing-is-ever-recomputed)). That re-application *is* the dormancy
model: a deposit whose `enabled` stops holding (or whose `disabled` starts) is withdrawn from the slot at that
instant — the source goes quiet without being removed.
⚑ **Both routes are reverse indices derived from the compiled deposit index** (atom → the deposits it gates,
count-key → the deposits it scales), so the cost is the deposits that atom or count actually touches — never a
walk of the scope's deposits asking each whether it cares, and never a sweep of the entity database.

> **⛔ THE TWO INDICES ARE KEYED THE SAME WAY AND ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE — asking the wrong one answers EMPTY,
> which is indistinguishable from "nothing is conditioned on this".** A condition atom's `type` interns into the
> **ATOM** index (`gatedByType`); a `per` scaler's token interns into the **COUNT** index (`gatedByToken`). Both
> are keyed by a plain string, so `"ERA"` is a legal key in either — and a route that reaches for the wrong one
> compiles, runs, reports nothing, and moves nothing.
> ⚑ **The tell is that a bare TOKEN can appear on both sides.** Most atoms are `INFOTYPE_NAME` ids and most
> count-keys are tokens, so the two key spaces look disjoint until a family uses a token as a THRESHOLD:
> `{type: "ERA", max: 1}` is a condition (atom index), while `per: {type: "ERA"}` would be a scaler (count index).
> ⇒ **When wiring a route, decide which QUESTION the deposits ask — "is this gate true?" or "how many?" — and
> take the matching index. Where a family is authored both ways, route BOTH.**
> ⚠ An empty list is silent by design (the route census reports nothing when the list size is zero), so a
> mis-keyed route leaves no trace at all. **Report the real list size, never a placeholder** — that count is the
> only thing that distinguishes a route with nothing to do from a route asking the wrong question.
>
> **⛔ AND A THRESHOLD IS NOT A PRESENCE CROSSING, so it cannot ride the ±1 atom route.** An `ERA`/`POPULATION`
> threshold has no held/not-held verdict for the as-if-held hypothetical to pin: when the counter moves, some

> idempotent if the fact is seen twice. The `±value` crossing form is only ever correct for a genuine presence

- **`enabled` then `disabled`** — `enabled` is read first, `disabled` second; a `disabled` that holds overrides
  ([json](specs/json.md) §3.9).
- **`per`** scales the deposit by a count — local at `city`/`plot`, via the [tally](specs/tally.md) at cross-city scopes.
- Whole-entity availability (is this building active at all?) is the [enabler](specs/enabler.md)'s `requires`, not a
  per-deposit condition: a dormant entity deposits nothing, so the modifier machine never special-cases it.
- **Age-gated deposits** — legacy `CommerceChangeDoubleTimes` ("double after N YEARS") is **not** a timer/stage
  but a SECOND deposit on the same slot with `enabled:{existedFor:{min:N}}` (no post-sum multiply). ⚠ The unit is GAME
  YEARS, not turns — the age is measured against the stored build YEAR, and that is what the tooltip has
  always promised ([json.md §3.5](specs/json.md)).

## 4. Ownership — the deliveryguy rule

> **This doc is the home of the deliveryguy ruling.**

A cross-entity modifier (X-keyed-by-Y) — does it live on X or fold onto Y? The test is **semantic sense: who
BRINGS this modifier to the table?** That deliverer **owns** it; the other entity is referenced as a
**condition** (`enabled` / `requires`), never the home. Two shapes, chosen per case by what reads cleanly:

- **own-output** — an entity's *own* produced output (a specialist's yield, an improvement's tile yield, a
  unit's strength) lives on **that entity**, with tech/civic/building as an `enabled` condition. *A civic
  boosting a Merchant's commerce → on the **specialist**, `enabled:{civic}` — NOT on the civic.*
- **governing-deliverer** — an entity that *delivers/governs* an effect on others lives on **the actor**, keyed
  by the target. *A route upgrading improvements → on the **route**, keyed by improvement.*

Plot-substrate entities (terrain / feature / improvement / route) each own their own `plot`-scope output. The
rule has **no special cases** — every cross-entity modifier lands by it.

**Conditioner axis:** a **tech** conditions on the **enabling** axis (`enabled:{tech}`, monotonic — once you
have it, you keep it); a **religion / resource** conditions on the **requiring** axis (`requires.operate`,
reversible — it can be lost).

**Data ≠ runtime.** The JSON is organised for a human (one home per relationship); `readJson` builds the links
both ways at parse so the machine reads top-down. Any "land it on the target" is a **parse transform**, never an
authored shape.

> **⛔ THE TWO TRAIT SETS ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATE — SEPARATED BY ID, NOT ONLY BY FOLDER (owner).**
> A leader's traits resolve to ONE `CvTraitInfo` table from *either* its simple set (`traits/simple/`, the
> `DefaultTraits`) *or* its complex/Thunderbrd set (`traits/complex/`, the `DefaultComplexTraits`), chosen at runtime
> by **`GAMEOPTION_LEADER_COMPLEX_TRAITS`**. The curator emits both as **two cleanly-separated, self-complete folders**
> (`traits/simple/` + `traits/complex/`); a consumer **loads the one active folder** by the live game option — this is
> NOT an entity-level option gate and NOT a mid-game swap (any WorldBuilder mid-game trait swap is a post-migration
> concern).
> **A complex trait KEEPS ITS OWN `TRAIT_COMPLEX_` IDENTITY** ([naming.md](specs/naming.md): `TRAIT_` is a simple trait,

**`production` vs `buildRate`.** `production` = `InfoValuation::cityRate`'s PRODUCTION channel (total city output — scales every
build every turn; a flat ADD or city-wide percent). `buildRate` = `getProductionModifier(eItem)` (shrinks the
COST of a SPECIFIC item, never a per-turn yield), sub-shapes `buildRate.self` /
`.<scope>.{units|buildings|domains|unitCombats}.{TARGET}` (keyed) / `.<scope>.{units|buildings}` predicate-filtered
(the §5 plural target) / `.<scope>.{worldWonder|teamWonder|nationalWonder}` (category). (The "Versailles bug" =

## 5. Targets — scope-wide, object-plural, or keyed

A deposit lands in one of three ways ([json](specs/json.md) §6.1):

> **⚖ AN EMPIRE→CITIES DEPOSIT HAS TWO LEGS, FOR THE SAME REASON THE AMENITY FOLD DOES**
> (§ THE FOLD HAS TWO LEGS, above). A source above city scope delivers its
> CITY-scope deposits by fanning over the owner's cities — which reaches exactly the cities standing **at that
> moment**, and that is not all of them:
> - **at LOAD the emit order is not uniform**, and nothing makes it so: some empire-level facts are announced
>   before the cities deserialize and some after, so one grantor's fan lands and the next one's iterates an empty
>   list. A fan alone therefore delivers a subset decided by where a member happens to sit in a read.
> - **at PLAY a city that starts existing later** — founded, or acquired — receives nothing from what its owner
>   already holds, permanently.
>
> ⇒ **The second leg is the CITY's: when a city starts existing it folds the city-scope deposits of every source
> its owner already holds.** The trigger is the city's own OWNERSHIP fact, which is the one announcement common
> to founding, conquest and the save read alike — so there is no separate load pass and no city-founded special
> case beside it.
> ⛔ **It must be IDEMPOTENT rather than guarded.** The package already records which sources have deposited into
> it (the same liveness key planes B and C test), so the fold SKIPS what the fan already delivered. Suppressing
> the fan during load instead would work only while a hand-written guard stays in step with an emit order nobody
> controls; the package's own record cannot disagree with what was applied.
> ⚠ This is not a rebuild and not a recompute — the worklist is the owner's HELD sources, each resolved through
> the one per-entry evaluator ([the DRY single-implementation law](architecture/patterns.md#dry--one-implementation-per-calculation--evaluation-the-single-source-law)).

- **scope-wide** — no target: the scope object itself (the city is the common case).
- **plural object-target** (`plots` / `units` / …, predicate-filtered) — realized by evaluating the predicate
  against **every object of that kind in scope** and depositing onto each match. One uniform mechanism: an
  empire-wide sea-tile buff is `production.empire.plots {IS_WATER}`, applied to every worked water plot. This
  retires all the legacy per-plot-type / per-tile accumulators.
- **named-entity key** (`improvements.{FARM}`, `terrains.{…}`, `buildings.{…}`) — a deposit onto a specific
  named target, kept on the source (the deliveryguy, §4).

> **⛔ A KEYED DEPOSIT IS READ AS AN ENTRY-LIST READ OVER THE LIVE SOURCES — never off a scope package.** Outside
> PLOT scope a keyed entry deliberately does **not** fold into the scope's Σflat/Σpercent slots (only the plot's own

> a consumer answering *"how much does this source give THIS target"* asks each live source what IT deposits onto

>
> **⚖ A KEYED ROW'S REACH IS ITS AUTHORED SCOPE, AND BOTH SCOPES ARE REAL ON A BUILDING (owner).** A building is
> a per-city source, so a CITY-scope keyed row means faster HERE — *"units are scoped on the city the building is

## 6. The unit plane — a self-accumulator

A `unit`-scope deposit is a **self-accumulator**: source == target. A unit's promotions and unit-combat class
deposit their stat changes onto the unit itself (the existing additive promotion stack), summed for O(1)
concatenation as each promotion is added — not a downward cascade.

**Host-from-occupants** effects — what a city gets *per unit stationed in it* (military happiness/anger) — are
**not** a bespoke host-family: they're an ordinary deposit on the source (the civic/trait), scaled by a
predicate-filtered unit count and targeting `cities`: `happiness.empire.cities.{unit: IS_MILITARY, flat: N}`
([json](specs/json.md) §3.7). The **carrier↔cargo** behaviour splits across the two systems. The carry *ability* is a unit **skill** — whether
the unit may use the **load/unload** action is `is_cargo_vessel`, and the attack restriction it brings is
`defend_only` (both skills, [json](specs/json.md) §8). The *amounts* live in the **`cargo`** modifier family (a unit
self-accumulator, set on the unit or a promotion), with two complementary members:

- **`cargo.space`** — how much the unit **carries** *and what*: `cargo.space.{unit: IS_<domain>, flat: N}` — a
  carrier is `cargo.space.{unit: IS_AIR, flat: N}` (*you can't transport a plane on a landing craft*); an
  unrestricted hold is just `cargo.space.flat`. (From legacy `iCargo` + `DomainCargo`.)
  > **⚖ THE RESTRICTION IS THE CARRIER'S AND GOVERNS ITS WHOLE HOLD — including capacity a PROMOTION grants
  > (owner).** WHAT a carrier may take is a property of the carrier; HOW MUCH sums from every source. So a
  > restriction never binds only the entry it is written on: an ancient galley that carries civilians carries
  > civilians in the space `PROMOTION_TRANSPORT1` adds too, never a warrior in the promoted slot.
  > ⚑ **This is a real mechanic, not an edge case:** the whole ancient-navy transport line has **zero base
  > `iCargo`** and earns its hold by promotion (TRANSPORT1/2/3 on `UNITCOMBAT_WOODEN_SHIPS`), so the carrier
  > declaring WHAT and the promotion supplying HOW MUCH is the normal shape there, not an anomaly.
  >
  > ⚖ **A PROMOTION ADDS SPACE, NEVER PERMISSION — an INTENTIONAL divergence from legacy (owner: "we go with
  > yours, it's cleaner").** In the legacy game a transport promotion WIDENS the class carried: an unpromoted
  > galley takes a settler, a promoted one takes military. The ruled model does not reproduce that — WHAT is the
  > carrier's, fixed, and a promotion only ever changes HOW MUCH. ⛔ So do not "repair" this back by letting a
  > promotion author a wider qualifier: the behaviour change is chosen, and the reason is that a permission that
  > moves with promotions puts WHAT in two places and makes a carrier's rule unreadable from the carrier
  > ([validation.md](specs/validation.md) intentional-model-change class; the spec leads, legacy behaviour is not
  > preserved for its own sake).
  > ⚠ Consequence: a carrier whose base capacity is 0 still has a restriction to state, and the §3.9 entry
  > grammar has no payload-less form for it — an open item for the json spec.
  ⚖ **The "what" is ALWAYS a TAG predicate — that is what tags are for (owner).** The legacy restriction by
  `SPECIALUNIT_*` group (`SpecialCargo` / `SMNotSpecialCargo`) brings no new qualifier form with it: it authors as
  the same `{unit: IS_<TAG>}` shape as the domain case. ⚠ It does require the tag to exist AND to be
  DISCRIMINATING — several legacy groups are indistinguishable on the current tag set (people and troops are both
  merely `landUnit`; fighters and seaplanes both merely air/military), so converting one before its tag is minted
  silently WIDENS what the carrier accepts. Mint the tag first; that is ordinary open-registry authoring
  ([tags.md](specs/tags.md)).
  ⚖ **Capacity has ONE home, and Size Matters DERIVES from it (owner):** `smSpace` follows from how many units
  the carrier can hold, so it is never a second authored number ([json.md §9](specs/json.md)).
- **`cargo.size`** — the unit's cargo **footprint** (room it occupies when loaded), **defaulting to 1** if unset.
  (SizeMatters extends cargo via `smSpace`/`volume`/`volumeModifier` — a separate rework.)

No bespoke host↔cargo family is needed. The full unit-stat family vocabulary
(`strength`/`withdrawal`/`firstStrike`/… ) is [json](specs/json.md) §6; this is the largest surface and lands last.

> **Movement & range** are their own resolver subsystem, not ordinary downward families: `moveCost` is computed
> **per `(unit, edge)`** with a route `min`-override, double-move divisors, and a floor — it doesn't fit the
> "deposit DOWN → O(1) summed read" shape. **But the RESOLVER being bespoke does not make its INPUTS intrinsic
> (owner): a plot substrate's base movement cost IS the `movement` family** — `movement.plot.flat` on the
> terrain / feature / route — and it composes with the cascading deltas (tech route changes, promotion move
> bonuses) in the ordinary way, as the §3.9 entry list. The route case shows it directly: the base cost is the
> bare number and a tech-gated change is a conditioned entry beside it, in one slot.
> ⚑ The distinction to hold: **the resolver reads the family and applies its own arithmetic** (min-override,
> divisors, floor). What was wrong was parking the base value in `identity`, which carries no effects
> ([json.md §7](specs/json.md)) — a movement cost is plainly one.

### Specialist counts

- **`freeSpecialists:{<scope>:{any:N, SPECIALIST_X:M, …}}`** — granted specialists; `any` = an assignable-slot
  bucket, a typed entry is auto-assigned. Leaf is a count (a list when conditioned). ⚠ Here `any` is a **count key**
  (an untyped specialist slot), **NOT** the [json](specs/json.md) §3.4 condition combinator.
  > **⛔ `any` IS AN AMOUNT, NOT A TARGET — and that decides whether the family works at all.** The untyped
  > bucket is N slots whose specialist type the ENGINE picks at placement (the two-part seam below), so it
  > carries no target: it decodes as the **memberless scope-wide amount**, exactly like any other magnitude.
  > ⚑ The consequence is structural rather than cosmetic. A deposit carrying a TARGET segment is excluded from
  > its scope's package by construction (only point-foldable entries fold), so registering `any` as a target

- **`allowedSpecialists:{<scope>:{SPECIALIST_X:N}}`** — the manual-assign cap, per-type only (no `any`).
- `free` lives ON TOP of `allowed` (independent). Normally a modifier leaf is `<scope>.<unit>` (e.g. a bare
  number or `.flat`); specialist counts instead use a **count-by-type** leaf (the `SPECIALIST_*` type — or `any`
  — IS the key, its value the count) — the one sanctioned exception, chosen for legibility.
- **freeSpecialists are MODIFIERS, never grants.** A free specialist is alive **only as
  long as its source is** — building present / civic adopted / trait active — the continuous-deposit shape, not a
  handed-out provision. Every legacy `changeFreeSpecialistCount` apply (civic/trait/building) classifies to THIS
  family; none belongs to the grants machine (`specialists` is not in the [json.md §5](specs/json.md) grants vocabulary; *if
  anything is ever found that genuinely grants PERMANENT free specialists — surviving source destruction — we deal
  with it then*; no hypothetical machinery).
- **⚖ THE TWO-PART SEAM (the promotion-SPA seam pattern applied to specialists).**
  Free specialists split cascade-vs-engine in two parts: **(1) the AMOUNT** of free specialists is the
  CASCADE's — the summed `freeSpecialists` deposits (per type + the `any` bucket) from live sources;
  **(2) the PLACEMENT** — the engine decides how to place them within the parameters it has (typed entries
  auto-assign; the `any` bucket + citizen assignment ride the existing, reliable engine infrastructure);
  **(3)** consumers then *"simply deal with the OUTPUT of that"* — the realized per-type counts
  (`getSpecialistCount + getFreeSpecialistCount`) are a **sanctioned output-seam read**, never a
  self-containment ride-in. Demolition consequence: the cut replaces WHO MAINTAINS THE AMOUNTS (the cascade's
  summed deposits replace the `changeFreeSpecialistCount` process-applies feeding the placement); the
  placement machinery and its output reads stay.
