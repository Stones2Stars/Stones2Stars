# The Cascade Rebuild — how the S2S engine works, and what it replaced

> **What this is.** A guided tour of the engine's data side: how game data is stored, how "can I build
> it?" and "how much does it produce?" are answered, how state changes are announced, and how things get
> handed over. It exists so a newcomer — human or agent — can get a real overview in one read.
>
> ⛔ **It is a PRIMER, not an authority.** Every ruling below is stated in full in the doc that owns it, and

Stones2Stars is a mod of *Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword*, descended from Caveman2Cosmos. Over one
development cycle its derived-state layer was rebuilt from the ground up. This is what changed and why each
piece is shaped the way it is.
