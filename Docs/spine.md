## 1. The primitive and the KIND firewall

A caller `emit`s an event; every consumer that registered interest in that event's **KIND** receives it. KIND is
declared **at the call site, never inferred**.

Civ4 multiplayer is deterministic lockstep, so an authoritative count that differs per machine is a desync. KIND
keeps the synced and unsynced streams apart:

| KIND | meaning | synced? | consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`DOMAIN`** | game **state** changed (building built, unit created, tech researched) | yes — deterministic | logging + grants + cache-invalidation + out-of-process replay (NOT the in-engine tally — it reads the object-owned counts) |
| **`SAVELOAD`** | a fact was **read off the save stream** — a log of LOADING, never what sets state | no | **logging only** — never counted, never gates |
| **`DIAGNOSTIC`** | **code** ran (a function entered, a decision re-evaluated) | no — execution trace | **logging only** — never counted, never gates |
| **`TRACE`** | fine-grained "every step" | no | logging only |

> **⛔ `SAVELOAD` IS ITS OWN KIND AND NOT A `DIAGNOSTIC`, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS LOAD-BEARING (owner).**
> `DIAGNOSTIC` means CODE RAN. A save-load fact is a record of what the STREAM CONTAINED — a different
> statement — so filing it under `DIAGNOSTIC` would put *"the save says this plot is `TERRAIN_GRASS`"* in the

Only `DOMAIN` events carry authoritative synced state-changes (for observability, cache-invalidation, and the
out-of-process replay). The in-engine [tally](specs/tally.md) does **not** consume them — it reads the object-owned
counts directly. The payload is **raw** (typed fields, never a pre-formatted string) so the costly index→text
formatting defers to the gated logging consumer (§8) — when a gate is off, nothing expensive ran.

## 2. The `IEventConsumer` contract and the C++ shape

Consumers attach through **one C++03 interface, `IEventConsumer`** (a pure-virtual base, no data members) — the
`grants` and logging are independent implementations pluggable behind it (the realized exemplar of the project's
[interface-contract pattern](architecture/patterns.md)); the [tally](specs/tally.md) is **not** a consumer (it reads
objects). **Build order:** spine + the modifier scope accumulator → logging (broad) → grants → [modifier](cascade.md)
→ [enabler](specs/enabler.md). *(The tally is a read-only accessor, not a step on the spine.)*

`CvEventSpine.{h,cpp}` (`Sources/Spine/`) is the concrete shape:

- **`CvSpineEvent`** is a POD carrying **two payloads, not two exclusive modes**: the raw **DOMAIN state ints**
  (`iType`/`iA`/`iB`/`iC` + `iSrcLoc` = WHERE), which `grants` and the cache-invalidation consumer read; **and** the
  **render payload** (`iDomainTag`/`iEventId`/`aFields[]`, `SPINE_MAX_FIELDS = 16`; a field is `{int eTag; union{int
  i; float f; char* s; wchar_t* w;}}`, 8B/POD) that the one logging path formats.
  ⛔ **THE FIELD CAP IS A SILENT CEILING — `addI`/`addStr` DROP a field past 16 rather than failing.** So a
  census line that has grown to exactly 16 cannot be extended at all: the seventeenth term is simply absent from
  the rendered line, and absent reads identically to zero. ⚑ Check a line's field count before adding a term,
  and when it is full the answer is a SECOND event, never a swap of one term for another — which is the right
  shape anyway wherever the new term has an axis of its own (a per-type row is not a term). *(`[MODIFIER] rateRead`
  stands at exactly 16, which is why the `specialists` decomposition is its own line.)* A **`DOMAIN`** event carries
  BOTH — its state ints for the machine consumers **and** a domain tag + fields so it renders through the same
  registered path as everything else; a **`SAVELOAD`/`DIAGNOSTIC`/`TRACE`** event carries only the render payload.
  There is no inline-formatted event: the spine's own DOMAIN events register under `SD_SPINE` exactly like an AI
  domain.
- **Per-domain isolation:** a domain registers via `spineRegisterDomain` (a line-prefix fn + a field-info fn with
  typed index kinds `SFT_BUILDING`/`UNIT`/`BONUS`/…); `spineRenderEventLine` formats. **Zero global field registry,
  zero shared edits per domain** — adding a domain touches only that domain. **The logging consumer is exactly
  `gate(iLevel) → spineRenderEventLine → write`** — no per-event branch, no inline `sprintf`; a line's identity is
  entirely its registered prefix + fields. Every rendered line carries the game turn as its first field
  (`[TAG] t=NNN …`) — after the tag so prefix-anchored greps keep working — making each line self-placing in
  time (when did this actually fire) instead of inferred from burst position. Passing `NULL` for the file routes a
  domain into `Cascade.log` — a per-registration choice, not a constraint (§8).
- **The `/events` STREAM is its OWN registered consumer** (`CvSpineStreamConsumer`) — never a tee inside the
  logging consumer (that chained stream visibility to the FILE gate, so a quiet `gPlayerLogLevel` silently starved
  the stream). **DOMAIN events stream UNCONDITIONALLY** whenever the HTTP server is up (the facts the machine
  consumers see — the out-of-process replay feed); SAVELOAD/DIAGNOSTIC/TRACE lines stream at the stream's own
  verbosity knob (`gStreamLogLevel` / `Autolog__LogLevelStream`), **fully decoupled from `gPlayerLogLevel` /
  the file gate** — streaming everything never requires opening the level-4 file firehose, and turning the file
  gate up or down changes nothing about what streams. ⚠ SAVELOAD is deliberately NOT on the unconditional side:
  the load record is the highest-volume stream in the engine and would exhaust the bounded SSE slots during
  ordinary play. The SSE queue is capped; on overflow the first frame that fits again reports `[STREAM] dropped=N`
  — a gap is always visible as a gap, never silent. (The transport's own bound — **≤ 8 concurrent stream slots**,
  `503 {"error":"too many event streams"}` beyond that — is [http-endpoints.md](specs/http-endpoints.md).)
- **Interest guard:** an `m_iInterestMask` bit-test gates dispatch, so the verbose call-site `if(logLevel)` gates
  vanish structurally.
- **Allocation-free hot path** (stack-buffer formatting, a bounded `/events` queue) — 32-bit ceiling discipline.
- **Name-change event** (`SEVT_NAME_CHANGE`): the four set-name choke points emit `(NameChangeKind, owner,
  entity_id)` in the DOMAIN ints (an out-of-process consumer keys on those). Because the logging consumer is generic,
  the `emitNameChange` endpoint resolves the NEW name + kind LIVE and passes them as render fields (`SFT_STR` kind +
  `SFT_WSTR` name — the emit render is synchronous on the game thread, so the borrowed pointers outlive it). This is
  the one place a spine endpoint does resolution at emit rather than deferring to the gated render — justified
  because a rename is rare (four low-frequency choke points), not a hot-path firehose.

**The spine primitive, KIND firewall and `IEventConsumer` live in `Spine/CvEventSpine.{h,cpp}`.** The **DOMAIN
emit surface** sits at the genuine mutation choke points across `CvPlayer`, `CvCity`, `CvPlot`, `CvUnit`, `CvGame`,
`CvProperties`, `CvTeam`, `CvArea`, `CvMap`, `CvPlotGroup`. The PLOT substrate is complete: terrain / feature /
improvement / route / bonus / owner / **type / river / irrigation / landmark / worked**, so the per-scope contexts
are maintained purely by facts, with no choke point driving a derivation directly
([contexts.md](cascade.md)).

## 3. The DOMAIN emit surface — every fact names a happening

**The spine is the SINGLE place a state change is announced.** Every game state change emits ONE source-carrying
DOMAIN event through a clean endpoint (`emitBuildingChanged`, `emitTechChanged`, `emitImprovementChanged`,
`emitCityOwnerChanged`, …); the event names WHAT (`iType`), WHO (`iC`, owner/triggering player), and WHERE
(`iSrcLoc` = cityId | plotId | -1). `emit()` dispatches **synchronously** — it is not an async listener bus; it calls
each interested consumer's `onEvent` inline at the mutation site. So nothing else in the engine detects changes: the
hand-wired per-site invalidation is retired in favour of this one surface.

**TURN BOUNDARIES are spine events, not a side-channel.** `SEVT_TURN_STARTED` / `SEVT_TURN_ENDED` (DOMAIN — the
turn counter advancing is a genuine synced state change) carry `iType` = the game turn and `iC` = the player, with
**`-1` marking the GAME-scope boundary**. The game pair straddles the counter advance in `CvGame::doTurn`
(`ended` = the closing turn, `started` = the incremented one); the player pair rides `CvPlayer::setTurnActive`.
They **replaced** the bespoke `CvHttpServer::publishEvent("turnStart"/"turnEnd"/"playerTurnStart"/"playerTurnEnd")`
publishes — a happening lives on the spine ONCE and the file + `/events` consumers carry it for free, rather than
each surface growing its own emitter (the server SERVES, it does not accumulate — §8). ⚠ **Consumer-visible break,
accepted (owner):** the wire form is now the standardized `[SPINE] turnStarted`/`turnEnded` rendered line, not a
named SSE frame carrying `{"turn","gameId"}`. The player pair emits for **every** player, not just humans: a turn
going active/inactive is a state mutation, and the spine's contract is that every mutation emits while CONSUMERS
filter (a consumer wanting humans only tests the player field) — a deliberately partial emit surface is what
defeats the missed-emit tripwire.

**⛔ ADD ALL THE EVENTS, EVER — the ONLY bar is DUPLICATES (owner).** *"As long as it's not duplicate events, go
nuts, add all the events, ever."* The emit surface is meant to be EXHAUSTIVE: every state mutation in the engine
announces itself, and completeness is the goal rather than a budget to spend carefully. This is not enthusiasm —
it is the ordering the whole model rests on — *"the EMIT surface comes first; the cache build is the step AFTER —
caches cannot build from events until the events are completely emitted"* — so an incomplete emit surface is a
foundation defect, not a backlog item.

⛔ **The ONE thing to avoid is a DUPLICATE — the same fact announced twice.** One fact, one emit, at the genuine
mutation choke point. Two emits for one state change double it for every counting consumer and make the stream
lie about what happened; and if two call sites both look like the choke point, the real fix is finding the one
that is (or emitting from the single place they both pass through), never picking one and hoping. Distinct facts
that happen to fire together are NOT duplicates — emit both.

### ⛔ A FACT NAMES THE HAPPENING — "something changed" IS NOT A FACT (owner)

> *"`BUILDING_CHANGED` is not a valid event — it says that 'something happened', not what actually happened. Any
> event that is not specific relies on actual calculation to happen."*

**THE TEST, and it is about the FACT, never about what any consumer currently does with it: does the event name
WHAT HAPPENED, or only that some state moved?** A fact that names only the movement has handed the consumer a
question instead of an answer, and the only way to answer a question is to CALCULATE — so the calculation the
spine exists to delete reappears inside every consumer at once.

⇒ **It is [a staleness flag is the fossil of a missing emit](cascade.md#-a-staleness-flag-is-the-fossil-of-an-incomplete-emit-surface--the-same-rule-one-level-up) wearing the emit side's costume.** A
staleness flag says *"something in this bucket moved"*; a `*_CHANGED` event with a direction bit says *"something
about this entity moved"*. Both discard the identity of the happening, and both leave the consumer to reconstruct
it. **A non-specific event is a staleness flag that learned to travel.**

**⛔ SO WHERE SEVERAL DISTINCT HAPPENINGS REACH ONE CHOKE POINT, THEY ARE SEVERAL FACTS — never one fact with a
discriminator field.** A payload int that a consumer must branch on to find out what occurred is the tell: the
branch is the calculation, merely relocated from the consumer's body into its `switch`.

⚑ **The tree already contains the correct shape, so this is a convergence and not a new design.** The UNIT plane
is named happenings throughout — `UNIT_CREATED` / `UNIT_KILLED` / `UNIT_ENTERED_CITY` / `UNIT_LEFT_CITY` /
`UNIT_DEATH_SCHEDULED`. Nobody wrote a `UNIT_CHANGED` carrying `±1`, and the reason is visible in what those
facts buy: a consumer acts on each one directly, and none of them has ever needed a companion event to say what
it meant.

⚑ **And the argument is already recorded in this spec's own history, against exactly this failure.**
`SEVT_CITY_FOUNDED` exists because founding *"produced NO identifiable fact before this, only a constellation of
side-effects (`populationChanged`, `plotOwnerChanged`, `cityNetworkChanged`), which is why the settle-time
provisions had no trigger to hang on."* A constellation of `*_CHANGED` movements could not substitute for the
named happening — that is this rule, discovered once and then not generalized. Generalize it.

⛔ **Splitting one `*_CHANGED` into its happenings is NOT the banned DUPLICATE.** A duplicate is ONE happening
announced twice; this is SEVERAL happenings that were being announced as one. The rule above already settles it:
*distinct facts that happen to fire together are not duplicates.* The choke point stays single — it simply emits
the fact that names what it just did.

> **⛔ `*_CHANGED` IS NOT A VALID EVENT NAME. FULL STOP (owner).** *"CHANGED is literally not a valid event

**⛔ TOO MANY EVENTS IS BETTER THAN NOT ENOUGH (owner) — and if an emit is found not to exist, ADD IT.** When
weighing whether some mutation "deserves" an event, the answer is EMIT. The costs are wildly asymmetric: a
MISSING emit is a silently wrong value that no compiler and no runtime catches, found only by someone noticing a
number is off; a SURPLUS emit costs one consumer branch that declines to act. Never agonize over the judgement —
if it moves state, it emits.

**⛔ AN EVENT GAP IS CLOSED THE MOMENT IT IS FOUND — NEVER RECORDED AND LEFT (owner).** Finding one is not a
discovery to write down; it *is* the work item, and it is done now. This is stronger than the ruling above, and
it binds the same way whichever form the hole takes: a **missing emit** (nothing announces the fact), a
**missing FIELD** on an existing fact (the old-value case above — it fires but cannot be acted on), or a
**missing CONSUMER ROUTE** (the fact is on the wire and the store that needs it ignores it — §6). All three leave a
stored value permanently wrong and none self-heals
([self-heal is not a backstop](cascade.md#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban)) — so a todo entry reading *"`SEVT_X` is the
hook"* is a value that stays wrong for exactly as long as that entry sits there.
⚑ **Why it is a hard rule and not a priority call:** closing one costs almost nothing while the trace is in
front of you, and it never gets cheaper — the next agent must re-derive which fact was missing, which consumer
wanted it, and why. Deferring converts a few minutes of wiring into a re-investigation.
⚠ It does NOT license guessing a structure: if the route needs a design decision the specs do not answer,
surface that — but the gap still closes in the same work item.

⚠ **The ruling above is about EMITS, and it does NOT extend to what a consumer DOES with one.** A surplus emit is
~free; work a consumer performs is paid on the turn path at event volume. So: **emit liberally, apply
precisely** — a consumer acts on exactly the deposits the fact names ([state-repositories.md](cascade.md)
§ THE MAINTAINED SUM), never on a widened mask and never on a whole-scope sweep it could not derive
([self-heal is not a backstop](cascade.md#-a-self-heal-is-the-fossil-of-a-missing-emit--so-it-is-a-search-not-just-a-ban)). Turn DURATION analytics remain the `[PERF]`
phase logs' job, not these facts'.

### The named fact families

⚖ **BESIDE THE SUBSTRATE FACTS, THE PLOT ANNOUNCES ITS OWN DERIVED VERDICT: `SEVT_PLOT_PREDICATE_ADDED /
_REMOVED`, carrying the `CASC_PRED_*` id.** It is emitted by `PlotContext` — the store that OWNS the verdict —
at the 0 ⇄ 1 crossing and nowhere else, exactly as the amenity fold announces its own crossings: the fold IS
the maintenance path, so an emit anywhere else would be a second one.
⛔ **It is NOT a duplicate of the substrate fact and never replaces one.** A substrate fact says what the TILE
now CARRIES; this says what that MEANS for the one predicate that moved. A consumer routing on a substrate id
is asking about the SOURCE; a consumer routing on this is asking about the VERDICT.
⚑ **It exists because the city cannot derive it.** `CityContext.plotAttrs` is the fold of its member plots'
bits, and by the time any consumer runs the plot already holds the NEW value — so a city-side "unfold the old
bits, refold the new" is impossible, not merely wasteful ([contexts.md](cascade.md): the plot
sends its bit UP, the city never reaches down). With the fact, a member plot's bit is one `add(bit, ±1)`.
⚠ Its absence would not read as a stale gate but as a **COMPOUNDING MAGNITUDE**: `plotAttrs` is plane B's
COUNT, so a bit never withdrawn leaves every deposit scaled on it permanently inflated, and inflated further on
every later substrate change.

⛔ **THE SUBSTRATE FACTS ARE `ADDED`/`REMOVED` PAIRS, NOT `CHANGED` (owner ruling).** Terrain / feature /
improvement / route each announce a source LEAVING and a source ARRIVING as two facts, because each end is its
own consumer work: the old source's deposits are withdrawn, the new source's applied. ⚑ Carrying the old value
in `iA` on one `CHANGED` fact was the earlier shape and it is what left the gap — a single "the slot moved" fact
makes every consumer DERIVE the removal, and the derivation is impossible once the state has moved. A `REMOVED`
fact is emitted while the old state still holds, so a withdrawal resolves against exactly what it deposited
([state-repositories.md](cascade.md) § THE INVARIANT).
⚖ **THE WHOLE FAMILY IS `<SCOPE>_<THING>_ADDED` / `_REMOVED`, SCOPE-QUALIFIED (owner):** `PLOT_BONUS_ADDED` /
`PLOT_BONUS_REMOVED` beside `CITY_BONUS_ADDED` / `CITY_BONUS_REMOVED` — a resource appearing ON A TILE and a
city GAINING that resource are different happenings with different consumers, so the scope belongs in the
name rather than in a reader's head.
⛔ **AND A ±1 IN THE PAYLOAD IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE NAME.** A `CHANGED` fact carrying a placed/removed
delta still hands the consumer a discriminator to branch on, which is the calculation relocated into a
`switch` — it is an improvement on an old-id payload and it is not the answer. The direction belongs in the
FACT'S IDENTITY, where a consumer reads it by arriving at all.
⚑ **The payoff is that every consumer's direction-decoding collapses.** A consumer that today decodes three
conventions — an id pairing, a presence boolean in `iA`, a signed delta in `iB` — decodes none: the event it
received IS the direction. The **commerce SLIDERS** are on the surface too
(`SEVT_EMPIRE_COMMERCE_PERCENT_ADDED / _REMOVED`, `CvPlayer::setCommercePercent` — the one choke point
`changeCommercePercent` / `verifyGoldCommercePercent` / `changeCommerceFlexibleCount` all reach the value
through): a slider is synced player state every city's realized per-commerce rate is built on
([modifier.md](cascade.md) §2a), so DOMAIN. ⚠ **ONE slider move emits SEVERAL facts** — the setter
REBALANCES the other channels in place to hold the total at 100, writing them directly rather than recursing, so
each channel it moves emits its own fact; a consumer reading only the caller's channel sees a 100-total that
does not add up. **PROPERTY VALUES** are on the surface too (`SEVT_PROPERTY_ADDED / _REMOVED`, the three
`CvProperties` mutation choke points — `setValue` plus the two new-property `push_back` branches, which
`changeValue` / `changeValueByProperty` / `setValueByProperty` all funnel through): `PROPERTY_*` is one cascade
channel per property info ([state-repositories.md](cascade.md)), read by
`CityContext::propertyValue`, by every `requires.operate` property BAND ([enabler.md](specs/enabler.md) §3) and
by every threshold-conditioned deposit, and the value is synced save-carried state that folds into the OOS
checksum — so DOMAIN. The fact names the object KIND beside the object id, because a city id and a plot id are
otherwise the same int. It is emitted at the three `CvProperties` mutation choke points, which every owner scope
funnels through. ⚠ The solver's change PROPAGATION fans one change onto OTHER objects, each of which re-enters
the mutation path — distinct objects' facts, so each emits. The object RESET path (`CvProperties::clear`)
deliberately announces nothing (it runs before there is an id or an owner to name — `CvCity::read` / `CvUnit::read`
call `reset()` as their first act).

⚖ **`isPowered()` announces ONCE, and what it announces is the VERDICT — never a leg.** `CvCity::isPowered` is
the ONE definition (a live grantor supplies power AND no blackout gates delivery), and its crossing is announced
by the AMENITY FOLD as `SEVT_CITY_POWER_ADDED / _REMOVED` — the fact the modifier's plane-C route and the
enabler's gate both ride. Its inputs reach that fold and stop there: the grantor crossing itself, and the
blackout status (`SEVT_CITY_STATUS_ADDED / _REMOVED` carrying `CITYSTATUS_POWER_DISABLED`), which is MIDDLEWARE
gating delivery and is never a cascade input ([state.md](specs/state.md) § A STATUS IS MIDDLEWARE).
⛔ **Announcing a LEG instead would be wrong twice**: no single leg is the verdict (a second plant built during a
blackout moves the store and delivers nothing; a blackout lifting delivers power with the store unmoved), and
routing several legs into one plane-C application would double-apply. ⚠ A status TICKS DOWN every turn, so it
emits at the derived 0-CROSSING only, never per decrement — a counter that moves on a schedule is not a state
change until its verdict flips, and this is the general rule for every timer-backed fact.

> **⚖ THE THRESHOLD CROSSING IS ITS OWN FACT, AND THE HOLDER OF THE VALUE ANNOUNCES IT (owner).** *"There
> should be events for when a threshold actually changes; that is done on the holder … if power goes from 0 to
> 1 an event is emitted, but another event is not emitted from 1 to 2 — and if 1 to 0, then power removed is

Beside them: **`SEVT_CITY_HEADQUARTERS_ADDED / _REMOVED`** (`CvGame::setHeadquarters`, per affected city — the
`setHolyCity` shape, and **not** a duplicate of the building/corporation PRESENCE facts the same setter drives),
**`SEVT_PLOT_CITY_ADDED / _REMOVED`** (`CvPlot::setPlotCity` — the ONE emit covering its `changeCityRadiusCount` /
`changePlayerCityRadiusCount` pass-throughs), **`SEVT_CITY_AMENITY_ADDED / _REMOVED`** (the city's AMENITY FOLD
crossing 0 ⇄ non-zero on ONE key, carrying the `AMENITY_*` id in `iType` — an OPEN-registry member id, the
`SEVT_CITY_STATUS` shape, so a newly authored amenity needs no engine change. It is emitted by the FOLD, the
store that owns the verdict, and by nothing else. ⚠ Government centre and fresh water ride THIS fact and carry
no pair of their own: nothing gates their delivery, so the refcount crossing IS their verdict and a bespoke
fact for either would be one happening announced twice. POWER is the exception and keeps its own pair — it
announces the GATED verdict (`isPowered`), which genuinely differs from the store crossing),
**`SEVT_EMPIRE_ANARCHY_ADDED / _REMOVED`** (`CvPlayer::changeAnarchyTurns`), **`SEVT_TEAM_MEMBER_ADDED / _REMOVED`**
and **`SEVT_AREA_TILE_ADDED / _REMOVED`** (the two bare counters `EmpireContext::teamMemberCount` / `CityContext`'s
AREA_SIZE + max-adjacent-water read), and **`SEVT_WORLD_UNIT_CREATED_COUNT_ADDED`** (the world-instance cap's
cumulative counter — distinct from `SEVT_EMPIRE_UNIT_COUNT_ADDED / _REMOVED`, the player's LIVE per-type tally, and
from `SEVT_UNIT_CREATED`, the instance; all three fire at one birth and none duplicates another).

**THE UNIT PLANE has its mark triggers** — [state-repositories.md](cascade.md) specifies a
unit's resolved values move on a promotion or combat-class change plus one seeding gather at birth:
`SEVT_UNIT_PROMOTION_ADDED / _REMOVED` (`CvUnit::processPromotion`, the ONE funnel both `setHasPromotion`
overloads reach), `SEVT_UNIT_COMBAT_ADDED / _REMOVED` (`CvUnit::processUnitCombat`, reached once past
`setHasUnitCombat`'s change guard AND its game-option/spy validity gate), and `SEVT_UNIT_CREATED` itself — the
seed that serves the unit's OWN info's share (the non-delta slots, vision above all, carry the unit's base),
without which a unit holding no promotion and no extra combat class never gathered and read 0 sight. ⚠ At LOAD
the seed is the unit marking ITSELF at the end of its own `read()` — the consumer's mark cannot serve a
save-carried unit, because its getUnit lookup runs while the player's unit list is still mid-stream and silently
resolves nothing; the created/promotion facts remain the play-time triggers. **`SEVT_UNIT_KILLED`** is the DEATH
TWIN `SEVT_UNIT_CREATED` lacked — without it grants and the out-of-process replay see units born and never die.
⛔ Its correctness is **STRUCTURAL, not positional**: it is emitted on the FIRST line of **`CvUnit::die`**, the
one function that ends a unit's life, which carries no early return and no conditional deletion and always ends
in `deleteUnit` ([unit-lifecycle.md](reference/unit-lifecycle.md)). The outcomes that leave a unit ALIVE
(evacuate-to-capital, last-stand survival) are decided BEFORE `die()` is entered and never reach it, so a new
outcome cannot silently slip in ahead of the fact — the shape a placement "past every early return" could not
guarantee. An OFF-MAP death is a real outcome of that function, not a skipped one: `iSrcLoc` is -1 and the unit
is deleted exactly as an on-map one is. Beside it, **`SEVT_UNIT_DEATH_SCHEDULE_ADDED / _REMOVED`** carries
`m_bDeathDelay`, the save-carried state a DELAYED kill leaves behind so the object outlives combat resolution,
read across the engine through `isDelayedDeath()`/`isDead()`. It is **not** a duplicate of KILLED: a scheduled
death is an INTENTION whose outcome can still flip to survival, so a consumer treating it as a death would bury
units that walk away. ⚠ Both TRANSITIONS announce (scheduled, and cleared by either survival outcome) — a
one-way fact would leave a survivor permanently marked dying — and `CvUnit::read` carries the in-read half for a
save taken mid-schedule. **`SEVT_UNIT_LEFT_CITY`** is the leave twin of `SEVT_UNIT_ENTERED_CITY`; ⚠ it is
announced for EVERY city plot a unit vacates while the ENTRY's conquest branch resolves into an acquisition
instead of an entry, so the two do NOT net to occupancy — a consumer needing occupancy reads the unit's live
plot.

**GAME OPTIONS and DIFFICULTY announce** — the two facts every maintained verdict is built on but nothing used to
announce. **`SEVT_GAME_OPTION_ADDED / _REMOVED`** (`CvGame::setOption` / `setModderGameOption`, both unguarded so
the emit supplies the flip guard): an option is the ONE axis an entity-level gate reads
([the whole-entity applicability gate](specs/json.md#2-anatomy-of-an-entity)), and options are read BELOW that level too (civics
carry option-gated production / happiness / commerce deposits), so a flip moves gate verdicts AND deposits at
once. ⚠ It carries TWO id spaces, so `iB` = `GameOptionSpace` disambiguates them (the `SEVT_PROPERTY_ADDED /
_REMOVED` shape — a game-option id and a modder-option id are otherwise the same int). **`SEVT_EMPIRE_HANDICAP_ADDED
/ _REMOVED`** (`CvPlayer::setHandicap`) is a genuine cascade input rather than observability: the gather folds the
handicap's own modifier families into that player's packages, so **FLEXIBLE DIFFICULTY moving it silently froze
every handicap-derived deposit at the old difficulty** with nothing to re-derive it. **`SEVT_GAME_HANDICAP_ADDED /
_REMOVED`** (`CvGame::setHandicapType`) is its DISTINCT twin, not a duplicate — the derived average over alive
humans that every `getAI*` advantage reads ([engine.md](reference/engine.md): AI advantages scale with the
HUMAN's difficulty), derived and never saved, so it needs no in-read half.
**`SEVT_GAME_GLOBAL_DEFINE_ADDED / _REMOVED`** completes that surface from the other side — the three
`cvInternalGlobals::setDefine*` setters, i.e. the **LIVE-OPTION bridge**: a BUG option fires a Python callback →
`GC.setDefineINT` → `cacheGlobals()`, so a user can flip an engine tunable at any time mid-game. It was the one
mutation of that class with no fact at all, which made a live option unreactable by construction.
⚠ It announces ONLY on the genuine LOCAL set: the `bUpdate` path sends a net message and
`CvGlobalDefineUpdate::Execute` calls straight back in with `bUpdate=false`, so announcing on both paths would
double-emit one change on the initiating machine. And a define is STRING-KEYED with no id space, so the NAME
rides as a render field (the `SEVT_NAME_CHANGE` precedent) and a machine consumer keys on that, not the ints.
⛔ Its existence does NOT make a live option something authored data may gate on — that ruling
([python-read-map.md](reference/python-read-map.md)) is about a value moving under static data and is unchanged;
the fact closes reactability only.
⚑ **Only the GAME space routes anywhere, and the two spaces differ in KIND, not just in id range.** A
`GAMEOPTION_` is fixed at setup, which is what lets an entity gate depend on it; a `MODDERGAMEOPTION_` is set
from the BUG menu at any time (`setModderGameOption` + a net message for MP sync), so it is a LIVE option
wearing a confusingly similar name. Authored data honours that split — **no** authored gate or condition names a
`MODDERGAMEOPTION_` — so a modder flip (a slider such as the leader-promotion culture threshold
`MODDERGAMEOPTION_NEXT_TRAIT_CULTURE_REQ_PERCENT`) moves no verdict and no deposit. It still EMITS, being a
genuine synced state change; it simply marks nothing. That is "emit liberally, mark precisely" as a routing rule
rather than a slogan. ⛔ Separating the two by grep needs a negative lookbehind — `MODDERGAMEOPTION_` contains
`GAMEOPTION_`, so a naive scan conflates them.
⚑ Both option and difficulty route to **WHOLESALE** consumer work (the enabler re-gates every city; the modifier
marks the affected player's packages whole) — the `SEVT_AREAS_RECALCULATED` shape, sanctioned for the same
reason: the fact names no source to route from, so no finer derivation exists, and it is not the banned
self-heal, which papers over a MISSED invalidation rather than announcing a genuine wholesale one.

### ⛔ WORLDBUILDER EMITS LIKE ANY OTHER PATH — no WB special case, anywhere (owner)

**⚑ WHY it is categorically different (owner): *"WorldBuilder can add or remove anything, at will."*** Every
other surface reaches state through a genuine acquisition — a building is CONSTRUCTED, a unit is TRAINED, a tech
is RESEARCHED — and this whole spine is built on that: one fact, emitted at the genuine mutation choke point. WB
instead mutates arbitrary state directly, so it can violate every invariant the model rests on — an entity
appearing with no acquisition, vanishing with no death, changing owner with no conquest. **A WB edit that changes
state silently leaves every cache, context and enabler set wrong, exactly as a missing emit does**; WB is simply
the surface that can produce that condition deliberately, on any field, in one click.

⛔ **So WB adding or removing anything EMITS, exactly as the normal path does.** Do NOT build a "WorldBuilder
mode" that suppresses or reroutes facts: a second, quieter mutation path is precisely the hole this model closes.
- **ADDING is "grants on demand" (owner)** — the grants machine hands an entity over on a genuine acquisition;
  WB hands the same entity over on a click. From the model's side they are the SAME event: same DOMAIN fact,
  every consumer reacting identically ([triggers.md](specs/triggers.md)).
- ⚠ **REMOVING is the mirror, and *"we do not have any"* (owner)** — a WB removal is an inverse grant, and the
  machine has no such notion, so the remove side cannot lean on precedent the way adding can. ⛔ The answer is
  NOT grant-removal machinery for WB's sake: the removal FACT must exist and be emitted, the same fact a genuine
  in-play removal would announce. **Those facts are THINNEST exactly where WB is most arbitrary**, because normal
  gameplay rarely removes — a tech is monotonic in play, but WB can un-research one. Expect to FIND MISSING
  removal facts rather than merely route existing ones; per *"add all the events, ever"*, the answer to a missing
  one is to add it.

⚖ **WB does not CONSTRAIN a cut, and that is not licence to leave a break (owner).** It *"will need a real review
and pass, post rework"* and may temporarily lag — so a WB path is never a reason to preserve a shape or keep a
legacy call alive. ⛔ But *"we cannot accept actually breaking worldbuilder stuff, we fix things we see"*: a WB
path that shows up broken, in a log or on screen, is wired onto the new surface like any other consumer, never
patched by restoring a legacy binding. The misreading that has already cost a pass is reading "not a constraint"
as "WB errors are accepted breakage" and skipping them in a sweep.

## 4. Consumers, registration order, and `CvEventReporter`

**⚖ PLAYER ALERTS ARE A SPINE CONSUMER, RE-ADDED ON THE FACT (owner) — never re-inlined at a mutation site.**
The legacy notifications ("a building shut down", "a building was restored") were emitted from inside the
setter that changed the state, which is why they die with every legacy mutator that gets cut — and why they
cannot simply be kept: the setter they lived in is the duplicate being removed. They come back as a CONSUMER of
the DOMAIN fact that already announces the change (the operate crossing, the owner change, …), exactly as
logging and the `/events` stream are consumers.
⚑ **This is a growing list, not a one-off:** each legacy mutator cut takes its alerts with it, and they are
re-added together on the facts rather than one at a time inside whatever replaced the setter.
⛔ An alert re-inlined into a machine's apply path is the same mistake in a new place: it makes a UI concern a
condition of the state change, and it is invisible to anything else that wanted to know.

**Registered consumers today:** the broad FILE logging consumer, the `/events` STREAM consumer, the **trigger
engine** (`Triggers/CvTriggerEngine` — the ONE payload machine, grants folded in as the null-condition case:
resolver AND appliers built (`tr_applyTechFirstDiscover` / `tr_applyBuildingFirstBuild` / `tr_applyPerTurn` /
`tr_applyCityPerTurn` / `tr_applySpawn` / `tr_applyFullHeal` / `tr_promoteFromEntries`), dispatched from
`SEVT_TECH_ACQUIRED` / `RELIGION_FOUNDED` / `PLAYER_INIT` / `CITY_FOUNDED` / `CIVIC_ADOPTED` / `TURN_STARTED` /
`BUILDING_ADDED` / `BUILDING_ACTIVATED` / `UNIT_CREATED` / `UNIT_ENTERED_CITY` / `CAPITAL_CHANGED`; the
remaining increments are in [triggers.md](specs/triggers.md)).
⛔ It registers **LAST**, after the contexts / enabler / modifier — the ordering rule and why is
[triggers.md](specs/triggers.md) § Registration order.
Beside it: the **enabler's own** consumer (`Enabler/CvEnablerConsumer`, load-active), and the **modifier's own**
consumer (`Cascade/CvModifierConsumer`, load-active for cache building): DOMAIN events in, the moved source's
compiled deposits APPLIED into the slots they feed — the maintained sum's one write path
([state-repositories.md](cascade.md)).
The **tally** is NOT a consumer — it reads the object-owned counts (`Tally/CvTally.{h,cpp}`).
⛔ **One consumer per system** — the shared consumer that routed BOTH machines is dead
([superseded-ideas](architecture/superseded-ideas.md) #16); never re-merge them.

### ⚖ `CvEventReporter` emits spine facts beside its Python calls (owner)

> *"I don't want to convert the current `CvEventReporter` yet, I simply want it to emit spineevents — so that
> things can be actually migrated down the line."*

**A happening that reaches only Python is invisible to the spine, to `/events`, to the file consumers and to
every C++ consumer.** `CvEventReporter` (`Sources/UI/CvEventReporter.{h,cpp}`, 85 `void` report methods) is the
engine→Python callback hub, and for a large part of its surface it is the ONLY announcement a happening makes.
So each method gains a spine emit ALONGSIDE its existing Python call.

⛔ **This is an ADDITION, never a conversion.** The reporter keeps calling Python exactly as it does; nothing is
rerouted, removed or re-bodied. Converting `CvEventReporter` onto the triggers machine is the LATER work item
([patterns.md](architecture/patterns.md): its successor is the triggers machine and *"events move INTO C++, but
that is not 430"*), and starting it here — one handler at a time — is the event rework beginning by accident.

⚑ **WHY THE REPORTER IS THE RIGHT EMIT SITE**, even though it is a reporting hub rather than a mutation choke
point: every method is CALLED at the happening with the parties already in hand
(`combatResult(pWinner, pLoser)`, `unitCaptured(eFromPlayer, eUnitType, pNewUnit)`). So the spine fact carries
**exactly what Python receives**, which is the property that makes the later migration a SWAP rather than a
re-investigation. An emit placed anywhere else would have to rediscover those arguments.

**⛔ THE FACT IS RAW, NOT FORMALIZED — and this is the part to get right (owner): *"we have no info, or way to
define a lot of these events in C++ yet; that will happen when we move the actual eventsystem over, when we can
clearly formalize all these python things in a structured json."*** The emit announces the happening with the
reporter's OWN arguments and invents nothing: no designed payload, no modelled semantics, no `on<Happening>`
token, no action verb. ⚑ That is also why this does not breach [triggers.md](specs/triggers.md)'s ban on minting
a happening or a verb speculatively — the AUTHORING vocabulary stays unminted; only the engine's announcement
lands. Anything designed now is undone by the formalization later.

**⛔ THE ONE BAR IS THE STANDING ONE — DUPLICATES.** A reporter method whose happening ALREADY has a spine fact
gets no second emit: `unitPromoted` (`SEVT_UNIT_PROMOTION_ADDED`), `techAcquired`, `buildingBuilt`
(`SEVT_CITY_BUILDING_ADDED`), `cityBuilt` (`SEVT_CITY_FOUNDED`), `religionFounded`. ⚑ **The worklist is therefore
a SUBTRACTION, not a judgement call: the reporter's method list minus the facts that already exist** — and what
falls out is the combat and arrival cluster that has never been on the spine at all (`combatResult`,
`combatRetreat`, `combatWithdrawal`, `unitCaptured`, `unitPillage`, `goodyReceived`, `cityRazed`, `nukeExplosion`,
`greatPersonBorn`).
⚠ **`unitKilled` is the case that must be DECIDED rather than skipped:** the reporter fires it from
`scheduleDeath` while `SEVT_UNIT_KILLED` fires from `die()`, and those are different moments — a scheduled death
can still resolve into survival ([unit-lifecycle.md](reference/unit-lifecycle.md)). Near-duplicate, not
duplicate; resolve it on the facts rather than assuming either way.

**⚖ THE KIND IS PER-METHOD, by the test §6 already states:** *does the fact say what the STATE is, or what some
CODE did?* `combatResult` / `unitCaptured` are state changes ⇒ **DOMAIN**; `combatLogCollateral` /
`combatLogFlanking` are log entries ⇒ **DIAGNOSTIC**. ⛔ Erring toward DIAGNOSTIC defeats the purpose: no
consumer may build state from one, so a DIAGNOSTIC fact cannot serve as the migration seam and would need
converting in a second pass.

⚑ **AND IT ANSWERS A TRACING GAP THAT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL (owner): *"it's hard to trace where things come from,
captives being the best example."*** A captured unit today announces `SEVT_UNIT_CREATED` and nothing else, so it
is indistinguishable from a trained, granted or WorldBuilder-placed one — and no provenance tag on
`UNIT_CREATED` could express a capture's SECOND PARTY. `unitCaptured` carrying captor and victim is what makes
the origin readable.

> **⚖ A SOURCE on `SEVT_UNIT_CREATED` IS A RENDER FIELD, AND ONLY A RENDER FIELD (owner).** Where the creating
> happening is worth reading off the existence fact, it rides the RENDER payload (the `SEVT_NAME_CHANGE`
> precedent — a field the machine consumers do not read), so the log answers *where did this come from* at a
> glance while `UNIT_CREATED` stays the one fact every "does this unit exist" consumer rides.
> ⛔ **The moment anything ROUTES on that field it is no longer diagnostic and must become its own fact**
> ([a fact names the happening](#-a-fact-names-the-happening--something-changed-is-not-a-fact-owner): a payload a consumer
> branches on is the calculation relocated into a `switch`).
> ⚑ Two facts at one birth is not a duplicate and the tree already does it deliberately —
> `SEVT_WORLD_UNIT_CREATED_COUNT_ADDED`, `SEVT_EMPIRE_UNIT_COUNT_ADDED` and `SEVT_UNIT_CREATED` all fire at one
> birth and none duplicates another.

## 5. The load reseed

**The load RESEED — the save read goes through the INTERNAL SETTERS.** A loaded save used to deserialize straight
into the `CvCity`/`CvPlot` members, so the setters never fired and the **cascade** (its value packages AND its
enabler side) had nothing to build from. The reseed is fixed **at the read itself**: each slot deserializes into a
LOCAL and is handed to that slot's **internal setter** — the ONE body that commits the member, maintains whatever
derived state the object owns, and announces the fact.

> **⛔ THE CRUD IS NOT THE EVENT; WHAT HAPPENED IS (owner).** The event does NOT set the state, and the earlier
> north-star that said so — *read → emit → populate* — was **backward**. It made an EFFECT the thing that mutates
> base state, which violates the principle the whole model rests on, and it is precisely what the old `*_CHANGED`
> payload existed to serve (an old value beside a new one, so a consumer could drive the mutation). **The stream
> is authoritative for base state; the fact is TESTIMONY about a completed act, in the past tense.**
>
> **⚖ THE PRINCIPLE, AND WHY THE OTHER ORDER COLLAPSES (owner): state is set DIRECTLY, in one request, and the
> event fires as a RESULT of that state having been set.** *"That is the core principle I violated… if you try to
> set state with events, you start getting real concurrency issues, and you have to start responding to state
> setting with more events, and the clownfiesta gets real."*
>
> **⛔ AND THE LINE IS BASE STATE vs DERIVED — THIS IS THE SPLIT THE CASCADE AND THE ENABLER ARE BUILT ON
> (owner).** The two halves take OPPOSITE rules, and collapsing them in either direction breaks the model:
>
> | | set by | the event is |
> |---|---|---|
> | **BASE state** — a building actually placed, population, research progress | its own SETTER, directly | TESTIMONY, after the fact |
> | **DERIVED state** — the cascade packages, the enabler's sets, the context stores | **the events themselves** | the MAINTENANCE path |
>
> ⇒ *"The derivation can be set from events; the actual base state cannot."* So
> [the maintained sum](cascade.md#-the-maintained-sum--three-planes-one-slot-and-nothing-is-ever-recomputed) is not an exception to the principle above

> existing because a fact arrived is the retired order.
> ⚠ **The misreading to avoid in each direction:** reading "events do not set state" as reaching the derived
> plane would ban the maintained sum outright; reading "events build the state" as reaching base state restores

> second, and neither is authoritative for the other's half.
> ⚑ **The failure is COMPOUNDING, not local, which is what makes it worth stating as a principle rather than a
> preference.** An event that SETS state is a mutation whose ordering is now a scheduling question, so every

Tech is team-held but emitted per-self from each member's `CvPlayer::read`, one emit per alive member; projects
the same. Beside the DOMAIN facts the setters emit, the read may announce what the STREAM CONTAINED as
`SAVELOAD` lines — a log of loading, consumed by logging alone.

**The load reseed, concretely:** `CvPlayer::read` per held tech / project / civic / trait / heritage + era /
golden-age / state-religion / nukes / commerce sliders; `CvCity::read` per building / religion + holy-city /
corp / specialist / population / power / culture-level; `CvPlot::read` the whole substrate + owner +
working-city — through the INTERNAL SETTERS, so the read announces nothing itself; `CvProperties::readWrapper`
per stored property value on every owner scope — wrapped by the `GAME_LOAD_STARTED` / `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED`
bracket. ⚠ The property block emits from its own read because a property value is DERIVED FROM NOTHING; nothing
else could announce it. A stored 0 is skipped, for the same reason the setter suppresses a no-op (the owner's
`reset()` emptied the bag, so 0 → 0 is not a change); the per-turn CHANGE ledger beside it is deliberately silent,
being an accumulation of deltas the value facts already carry. ⛔ **ONE SERIALIZED SLOT, ONE FACT — there is no
slot a neighbour's fact covers for.** A consumer must never reach back through an object to re-derive a block
from a fact that did not name it — a fact sets ONLY the bit it names ([contexts.md](cascade.md)),
so a slot nothing announces is a slot nothing knows about.
⚑ **The fix is structural, not a hand-maintained emit list:** the emit lives in the slot's INTERNAL SETTER, so a
newly serialized field cannot be added without going through the one body that announces it.
⚠ **The WORKED set is the CITY's slot, so it reseeds from `CvCity::read`, not from the plot's.** The plot
carries the `IS_WORKED` verdict but only the city can attribute it, so the array's in-read landing is where
the fact comes from — and the cities stream AFTER the map, which is exactly what makes the plot available to
carry the bit and puts the fact before the `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED` fold that reads each plot's FINAL block.

**The reseed grew the matching in-read halves** wherever the setter cannot run on a load: `CvCity::read` (the
disabled-power timer — a save can be taken mid-blackout — and the headquarters designation, tested off the
loaded IDInfo via `CvGame::isHeadquartersByOwnerId`, the `isHolyCityByOwnerId` precedent, because `CvGame`'s
array deserializes before the cities), `CvPlayer::read` (anarchy turns — a save can load mid-revolution — the
golden-age twin), `CvPlot::read` (the plot's city, whose fact no other slot covers — no slot ever covers for
another), `CvTeam::read` (the member count, landed through `changeNumMembers` after `m_eID` deserializes rather
than beside the count, since the id the fact hangs on is only valid from there — and that is the team's WHOLE
reseed, because `EmpireContext` forwards exactly three team facts and the other two, techs and projects, are
announced per-self from `CvPlayer::read`), and **`CvUnit::read`, which previously emitted NOTHING** — the
instance, its promotion set and its combat-class set, each at its own genuine per-element read.
⛔ Three in-read halves are deliberately ABSENT and are not oversights: **the world unit-created counter**
(nothing stores a derivative of it — the cap reads it live, so there is nothing to seed), **the area tile count**
(`SEVT_AREAS_RECALCULATED` is a WHOLESALE fact by construction — it names no source, so every area-id holder
re-reads on it and a per-area announcement would say nothing the wholesale one has not), and **the
fold-announced verdicts** (power / government centre / fresh water — the amenity fold rebuilds from the load's
own facts and announces each verdict crossing itself, so an in-read emit beside it would announce the same
crossing twice). ⛔ Neither is the retired *"another slot's fact covers it"* argument, which is why they are
stated in their own terms: one has no consumer to seed, the other already has a fact. **No slot is ever covered
by a neighbour's.**
⚠ **One endpoint is deliberately unwired: `emitLoadPipeline`** — every one of its arguments is produced by the
archived load-time warm-up/rebuild pass, which the CAPSTONE rule removed
([state-repositories.md](cascade.md)); the event reseed replaced that pass, so the
endpoint has no honest caller. Open follow-ups: the tile-driven vicinity backstop, and the per-city enabler
priming that preceded the reseed emits.

⛔ **What the reseed is NOT:** a separate pass that walks already-deserialized objects and **fabricates** events
from their populated state (a "for each building present, emit built"). That pseudo-emit feeds the cascade
reconstructed lies and trains the next agent to reconstruct more — it is banned
([superseded-ideas](architecture/superseded-ideas.md)). There is no clean middle between it and the real
event-sourced read, so the read-driven reseed is built as its own step, never shimmed.

**The load lifecycle is bracketed by two spine events — `GAME_LOAD_STARTED` / `GAME_LOAD_FINISHED`.** Result-producers
(grants, and any future on-event side-effect machinery) rely **purely on the spine**: they see `LOAD_STARTED` →
suppress, `LOAD_FINISHED` → resume, so nothing is granted during reconstruction (a grant is a RESULT of a genuine
in-play acquisition, and a load is not an acquisition). The **cache-build consumer** is the load-active one — it
consumes the in-read events to build the cascade. New game builds the same way: its real init fires the same
events, with grants active because those are genuine acquisitions. Ledgered as
[the load reseed](#5-the-load-reseed).

## 6. THE RECEIVED LINE — auditing the whole event flow live (owner)

> *"We can literally audit the entire eventflow with the `/events` endpoint live — all we have to do is have a
> 'received' event on the other side that is purely for logging."*

**A consumer announces that it ACTED on a fact.** Emitted lines and received lines then stream side by side on
`/events`, and the audit is a diff: **a DOMAIN fact with no matching received line names a MISSING CONSUMER
ROUTE** — the third gap form in [an event gap is closed the moment it is found](#-a-fact-names-the-happening--something-changed-is-not-a-fact-owner),
and the only one with no other observable signature. The first two forms are visible today (a missing emit leaves
the stream silent, a missing field leaves the payload short); this one is not, because the fact goes out
perfectly and is simply dropped on the floor. The worked case is `SEVT_PROPERTY_ADDED / _REMOVED`, which fires from
the `CvProperties` choke points into a consumer set that carries no case for it — a defect that took a code audit
to find and that a missing received row would have named at a glance.

⚑ **It is load-bearing under the maintained-sum model specifically:** the consumer route IS the maintenance
([state-repositories.md](cascade.md)), so this audits the correctness mechanism itself
rather than the number that falls out of it.

> **⚖ A "JOB DONE" ANNOUNCEMENT IS A RECEIVED LINE, AND IT IS ALWAYS `DIAGNOSTIC` (owner).** *"`SEVT_CITY_BUILDING_PROCESSED`
> is a 'I have completed my job' event, if anything, and should purely be logging."*
> ⛔ **THE TEST: does the fact say WHAT THE STATE IS, or WHAT SOME CODE DID?** A completion notice is the second,

⛔ **THE KIND IS `DIAGNOSTIC`, NEVER `DOMAIN` — and this is what keeps it from becoming the killed verifier.**
The firewall (§1) already defines `DIAGNOSTIC` as *"code ran (a function entered, a decision re-evaluated) …
logging only — never counted, never gates"*, which is exactly what a received line is, so it needs no new
machinery.
⚠ The near-miss to recognise is [superseded-ideas #19](architecture/superseded-ideas.md), the gated in-DLL
cache verifier, which was killed for putting a **divergence** on the spine: an event is an invitation to a
consumer, and the next agent's consumer "handles" a value known to be wrong by CORRECTING it — so the shape
itself licensed self-heal. **A received line announces THAT CODE RAN, never a VERDICT ABOUT A VALUE**, so it
contains nothing to correct. Emitting it as DOMAIN would make it a synced authoritative fact the machine
consumers may read, which is the shape that grows the self-healer, and would double the unconditional stream.
⚑ As DIAGNOSTIC it rides `gStreamLogLevel` — decoupled from the file gate — so it costs nothing until it is
turned on, and stays off the bounded SSE slot budget during ordinary play ([http-endpoints.md](specs/http-endpoints.md)).
⛔ It reports NO judgement and accumulates NO counter behind a route: it is a line, on the one surface that
already exists (the server SERVES, it does not ACCUMULATE — a fact that is on neither surface is EMITTED, never
given a side-counter).

**Events are FACTS, not causal steps.** "This building is here", "this tech is held" — order-independent,
prerequisite-free. Prerequisites are evaluated ONLY by the enabler (`canConstruct`/`canTrain`/`canResearch` — the
"*can* I?" question), never by a has-been-done fact; so the emit stream carries no ordering and no prereq logic.
Corollary — **yield is a computed RESULT, never an event**: emit the CAUSES (improvement/terrain/feature/route
changed), and a consumer computes the yield downstream.

## 7. What to log — the Orwell bar, the scale, and the three hook shapes

The **observability surface** for the whole cascade rework is *what the game exposes*. It is not polish: without
total observability the cascade ([enabler](specs/enabler.md)/[modifier](cascade.md)/[tally](specs/tally.md))
cannot prove it replicates the legacy machinery it replaces — so it cannot safely replace it.

### The reconstruction bar ("Orwell")

> **Reconstruct full game state from the HTTP endpoints + the `/events` stream + the gated logs ALONE — never by
> looking at the screen.**

The canonical test is an **AI-only autoplay**: with no human and no UI in the loop, every piece of state the AI
acts on *must* be readable from the wire, or it is invisible — which is exactly the bar. An AI-player read is
also a *purer* cascade-vs-engine comparison (no UI-display artifacts).

### The observability scale (0–5)

A system is rated on how deeply it can be observed: **0 Oblivious · 1 Telescreen · 2 Informant · 3 Big Brother ·
4 Thought Police · 5 Meta.** Most game systems sit at Tier 1 (a coarse snapshot, no *why*); climbing means adding
hooks (below) that expose the decomposition behind a number. Rate two axes **separately**: the
cascade/buildability surface, and the whole-game-state surface — a high score on one says nothing about the other.

### The three hook shapes

Every observability hook is one of these — cheap, gated, **off by default**:

1. **Snapshot field** — a read-only field on a served snapshot document (a game-thread copy).
2. **Gated `[TAG]` log line** — emitted under a log-level gate (`gPlayerLogLevel`/`gCityLogLevel`/…) and teed to
   `/events` so it streams live.
3. **Mailbox snapshot endpoint** — an on-demand snapshot computed on the game thread via the single-slot mailbox,
   depending on **no** log file or gate.

The HTTP transport, its standing invariants, and the routes that exist today are
[http-endpoints.md](specs/http-endpoints.md). ⚠ There is **no route catalogue** — the route table was purged and a
route is defined with the access surface it serves, so shapes 1 and 3 stay sparse by design rather than growing
a registry of their own.

Logging is one **`IEventConsumer`** behind the spine (§2) — so are grants and the `/events` stream; it does not
own the dispatch. It is the **broad** FILE consumer: it takes `DOMAIN`, `SAVELOAD`, `DIAGNOSTIC`, and `TRACE`
events and formats the raw typed payload to text **only when its gate is on** (an off gate costs nothing).

## 8. The live surfaces — gates, the tag registry, the server, and the files

### Gate knobs (the log levels)

- The four AI globals `gPlayerLogLevel` / `gTeamLogLevel` / `gCityLogLevel` / `gUnitLogLevel` are **aliases driven by
  the single `Autolog__LogLevelPlayerBBAI` BUG option**. `gPerfLogLevel` is independent. **`gStreamLogLevel`
  (default 1, `Autolog__LogLevelStream`) is its OWN independent gate, fully decoupled from `gPlayerLogLevel` / the
  file gate** — it is not a subset sitting on top of the file gate; a domain can stream at full volume while the
  file gate stays quiet, and vice versa (§2). `_DEBUG` forces all four AI globals to 4 — **inert in practice: the
  Debug config is not used** (it does not touch `gStreamLogLevel`).
- ⛔ **`gPlayerLogLevel` IS the gate for everything (owner) — the other three are FOUR NAMES FOR ONE NUMBER.** All
  four take the same value from the same option, so a per-scope name promises a per-scope knob that does not exist:
  **do not read `gUnitLogLevel` in some AI file as evidence that unit logging has its own tier.** A NEW gate reads
  **`gPlayerLogLevel`**.
  **⚖ The single-value collapse is a CONSCIOUS owner-ruled interim, NOT drift and NOT a deferral to close.** Giving
  each scope a real knob means BUG-UI work, which was deliberately declined against higher-value work — *"we just
  roll with `gPlayerLogLevel`"*. Its END CONDITION is the founding decree below: **ALL log events go through the
  EVENT SPINE (owner)**, so a CALL-SITE gate global is a legacy-of-a-legacy — once a domain emits, gating is the
  CONSUMER's business (the file consumer's level + `gStreamLogLevel`), and these four globals have nothing left to
  gate. They retire wholesale WITH the direct `gDLL->logMsg` / BetterBTSAI-helper call sites they guard, not by
  being tidied first. ⛔ **So do NOT "fix" this by collapsing the three names onto `gPlayerLogLevel`** — that is a
  sweep across a surface scheduled for deletion, and the ["deferred" is banned](../AGENTS.md#design) reflex ("slated and never done ⇒ failure
  to fix") MISREADS it. The work is MIGRATING DOMAINS ONTO THE SPINE; the gates then disappear on their own.
- **Level semantics:** 1 = headline (`begin`/`best`/`decision`), 2 = per-decision (`score`/`order`/`act`), 3 =
  per-candidate (`cand`/`skip`), 4 = inner-loop (a genuine fire hazard — CTB emits 10k+ lines/turn at 4). Owner plays
  at 3.
- **⛔ A DIAGNOSTIC BUILT FOR A DEBUGGING SESSION MOVES TO LEVEL 4 WHEN THAT SESSION ENDS (owner): *"we do not
  need diagnostics like this; 4 is where trace logs belong after we have finished debugging."*** The tiers above
  describe what a line COSTS; this says what it is FOR. **Because the owner plays at 3, anything at 1–3 is on
  during ordinary play** — so a trace kept at its investigation-time tier does not merely sit there, it runs
  forever, in every session, for a question nobody is asking any more.
  ⚑ **The instrument is KEPT, not deleted** — that is the point of moving it rather than removing it. It cost
  real effort to build, it is the thing that makes the same class of defect findable next time, and at 4 it is
  free until someone raises the gate. ⇒ Closing an investigation has a step: **re-tier its diagnostics to 4**.
  ⚠ The cost of skipping it is measurable, not theoretical: the `[GFX]` domain left at its investigation tiers
  (2 and 3) wrote a **133 MB** `Graphics.log` in one ordinary session — 77,245 `centerUnit` lines per 8 MB,
  including a full-map sweep of plots that draw no units at all — which is exactly the legibility loss the
  own-file rule below exists to prevent, arriving through the level gate instead.
- `OutputDebugString` is `#define`d to nothing under `FINAL_RELEASE` — it fires only in Release/Assert/Debug (any
  "fires in FinalRelease, CRIT" framing is wrong for the shipped build).

### ⛔ A domain gets its own log file — `Cascade.log` is not the default (owner)

> *"We really should stop having all these emits in the same file; `Cascade.log` is getting ridiculous as is."*

`spineRegisterDomain` already takes the file as a parameter, and passing **`NULL` routes the domain into
`Cascade.log`** — which is why they all ended up there. That is a per-registration choice, not a constraint:
name the file.

⚑ **The cost of not doing it is that the file stops being readable at the level you need.** A domain emitting at
level 3 buries a level-1 line from another domain in the same file, so turning the volume up on ONE question
costs legibility on every other — and the whole point of a spine-written file is that it is readable while the
game runs.
⚠ **This is not a sweep of the existing domains**, and it is not a backlog item: the ones sharing `Cascade.log`
keep working. It binds NEW domains, and an existing one moves when someone is already in it — the same
opportunistic disposition the contradicting-comment rule takes ([AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) Conventions §Docs).

### Domain / tag registry

14 domains, each `[TAG]` prefix → log file → scope global → source: e.g. `[WAI]` → `BuildEvaluation.log` →
`gPlayerLogLevel` → `CvWorkerAI.cpp`; plus `[CIT]`/`[UNT]`/`[COM]`/`[WAR]`/`[CTB]`/`[ENG]`/`[PERF]`. `[PERF/reqmodel]`
passes when `mismatches=0`. `[INIT/*]` was renamed from `[GAME/*]` to avoid clashing with the `[STATE/game]` cascade
feed. Call-site census exists (WAI 43 sites, HAI 54, CTB 66, …). Dead sinks: `CB.log`, `C2C.log` (ruled DELETE).

### ⛔ The internal profiler is DEAD — the CENSUS is the perf surface

**Never use the internal profiler; never reinstate the `PROFILE_*` macro family.** The one attempt to ship it in
**Release** (behind a runtime gate) caused an allocation-failure crash on end-turn and was reverted the same day.

⚑ **The mechanism, because it is what makes the family kraken bait:** `PROFILE_FUNC`/`PROFILE` are live in the
Profile configs but no-ops in Release/Assert — *the same line behaves differently per config* — and the
`PROFILE_BEGIN` sites (including a per-FRAME one) call the sampler **directly, bypassing any scope gate**. So
compiling the profiler into Release ran those ungated, per frame, with a critical section per call. There is no
fix-and-reinstate plan: removal is the direction. ⛔ Do not add, un-gate, or Release-compile any `PROFILE_*` /
internal-profiler path.

**What we use instead** is the gated per-turn CENSUS teed to `/events`: call counts (operating-building recomputes
vs cache hits, rate/percent-stack/commerce computes, condition-evaluator leaf evals), ms accumulators, the
condition-eval CALLER split (which is what makes an outlier attributable rather than merely visible), the
enabler-frontier fill counts + ms, and the flush-to-flush whole-turn wall clock — the headline number
([turn time is king](cascade.md#-the-per-scope-package-model--the-cascades-founding-design-1-stated-as-cache-architecture)). Non-invasive, always shippable, and
sufficient.

**The process `memory` gauge** (`workingSetMB`/`peakWorkingSetMB`/`pagefileMB`, the CvPlotPaging
`GetProcessMemoryInfo` mechanism) splits a per-turn RAM climb (leak) from a one-time step (retained structure) —
load-bearing under the 32-bit ~3.2GB address-space ceiling. ⚠ Its `/computed/perf` route went with the route-table
purge; the gauge needs a surface again when the route table is rebuilt.

### The live HTTP server (today)

- Bind **`127.0.0.1:7227`**, GET-only, gated by BUG option `Autolog__HttpServer` (default **off**). Full transport
  shape, the mailbox/route-table invariants, and why there is no `oracle` side: [http-endpoints.md](specs/http-endpoints.md).
- **The routes that answer** are four STORED-side documents, each serving what the events built, decomposed term
  by term: `/computed/cascade/packages` (per-scope flat/percent slots + receiver sums, by channel name),
  `/computed/enabler/operating` (the per-city operating set targeted propagation maintains), `/computed/city/yield`
  (the yield tooltip's own census — every term of the §2a combine, plus the REFUSED deposits with the atom that
  refused each one), `/computed/capabilities` (the empire ability union). Documents live in
  `Sources/Tools/CvStateEndpoints.cpp`, never in the server file.
- **The mailbox, concretely:** a data request runs on the **game thread** via a single-slot mailbox
  (`evalRequestBlocking` → `serviceEvalMailbox`, drained by `publishIfDue`); the server thread only renders the
  answer plus a tiny published `{turn,gameId}` header (refreshed every ~5 s). A second concurrent data request gets
  `503` — retry once.
- Predecessor surfaces (the flat `/units`/`/players`/`/cities` snapshot routes, the `/diagnostic/*` grab-bag, the
  cascade-vs-legacy `/shadow` sweeps) are gone and are not to be revived; the `/shadow` tombstone is
  [superseded-ideas](architecture/superseded-ideas.md) #12.

### ⚑ `LSystem.log` — the EXE's own city-render log, and the one surface that shows ART FAILING

A THIRD kind of log sits beside the spine-written domains and the legacy `gDLL->logMsg` sinks: **the closed EXE
writes `LSystem.log` itself**, recording how it lays a city out from `XML/Buildings/CIV4CityLSystem.xml`. Nothing
in this repo emits it and no gate controls it, so it is readable like a spine log and answers a question no DLL
surface can: **what the render engine did with what we handed it.**

⛔ **THE RUNNING GAME HOLDS IT OPEN, so it reads like a spine log and is NOT one (owner).** It is written by the
EXE, which puts it in the same class as the not-yet-migrated `gDLL->logMsg` sinks: a mid-session read is
PARTIAL, and the file keeps growing. ⇒ **Re-read it every time, and take any absolute count from a CLOSED game.**
⚠ **The trap is COMPARING two reads**, because the sizes are not stated anywhere in the numbers: a completed
session diffed against one still being written looks like a real before/after and is not. Compare RATIOS that a
truncation cannot explain (26,273 → 5), never totals — and re-read after the game closes before recording one.

⚑ **It is how an art gap becomes VISIBLE rather than merely suspected.** The lines that matter are
`Warning: building <id> is not associated with a CvCityLSystem node; it will not be visible!`, the
`does not contain a node called SHADOW` complaints (the engine loading `Art/Empty.nif` and trying to shadow it),
and `Failed to place goal building <ART_DEF>` / `Layout failed to complete while adding generic buildings!` —
i.e. the engine hunting for art that is not there, per layout rebuild, per city.
⚠ **The id is the building's RUNTIME INDEX**, so it reads as meaningless until resolved through the category's
`_order.json` manifest ([engine.md](reference/engine.md) § Info loading) — resolve it before concluding anything
about which building is at fault.
⛔ A warning naming a building that HAS real art and real scale is an **art-XML** gap (the entity is missing from
`CIV4CityLSystem.xml`), which is the ART carve-out ([json.md](specs/json.md)) — not a DLL defect. One that names an art-LESS building is ours: the city offered the engine
something it was never meant to place.

### The field census (event-spine migration input)

The exhaustive raw-field census: ~196 gated log templates across 10 domains, each field's name + cType + a sample
call-site. **Distribution:** ~80% int, ~15% string, ~5% typeIndex, ~3% float (PERF only); median 5–6 fields, ~85% fit
≤ 9, only 6 templates > 12. **Migration constraints:** wide `wchar_t*` strings can't travel raw on the spine — carry
entity IDs and let the consumer resolve names; `[STATE/dip]` is variable-width (scales with civ count); the `CTB`
pre-composed `CvString` criteria/joinInfo fields are the hardest to decompose; `[CIT/order] CONSTRUCT` score is an
`int64_t` outlier (needs a dual-slot / extended tag).

### PlotSnapshot — the one CSV surface

- Written at 4 call points (all from `CvGame`): `start` (new game), `load`, `regen`, `turn` (top of every `doTurn`,
  before AI decisions). File: `…/Beyond The Sword/Logs/PlotSnapshot_<tag>_t<turn>.csv`.
- **Rotation:** `turn` keeps only the last 3; `start`/`load`/`regen` wipe **all** other `PlotSnapshot_*.csv` — a turn
  file survives turn rotation but NOT a later start/load/regen (copy it out to keep).
- Uses raw `fopen`/`fclose` (gDLL holds handles open, blocking `remove()`); resolves `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\…` (not
  `SHGetFolderPath` — clashes with the `CATEGORY_INFO` macro), so it **fails silently under Documents redirection
  (OneDrive)**. Schema v2 includes the `animals` field (`<Type>@o<owner>c<combat>a<aggression>e<enemy>`) and the
  `improvementCurrentValue` `0 = uninitialised, not zero` caveat.

### Target consolidation

The migration target is one routing — `emit → CvEventSpine::dispatch → consumers` (§2): the eventSpine is the ONLY
place any "happening" lives, and everything downstream is a consumer of it (owner, founding decree). Concretely
(owner): **the BetterBTSAI log helpers (`logAIJson` et al.) are RETIRED — never route new work through them — and
every direct `gDLL->logMsg` inside Engine files is likewise unwanted**; each domain migrates by EMITTING spine
events (the field census above is the prepared input), whereupon it gains the file consumer, the `/events` stream
consumer, and the off-thread writer for free.

Every DOMAIN event gets an assigned importance LEVEL as it migrates (levels today are only meaningful on the
DIAGNOSTIC side; DOMAIN defaults to 1). The multiplayer **OOS special logger is deliberately KEPT** — a
synchronization-debugging surface in its own right, and a natural future consumer of the synced DOMAIN stream.
Old anomalies slated for removal: dead `logCB`/`logToFile` Python exports (an arbitrary-file-write surface), the
`C2C.log` firehose, the `rjLogLine` split gate (a hardcoded level-1 tee), and the `BetterBTSAI.cpp:31`
`publishEvent("log")` tee (the retired BetterBTSAI log-helper family).

**The FILE sink is the off-thread `CvLogWriter`** (`Infrastructure/CvLogWriter.{h,cpp}`): the game thread renders
+ enqueues; a dedicated Win32 thread does all disk I/O and flushes per batch — **so spine-written log files are
READABLE WHILE THE GAME RUNS.** The held-open pain applies only to the not-yet-migrated `gDLL->logMsg` sinks (and
to the EXE-owned `LSystem.log` above) — never infer "logging is off" from a quiet legacy log. Files are truncated
fresh per session; lines stamp `[sec.mmm]` at enqueue.

## 9. Reading the live surface — the rules

> **The running game holds its `.log` files OPEN — never live-read them** *(the not-yet-migrated `gDLL->logMsg`
> sinks and `LSystem.log`, §8; a spine-written domain file is the exception — it is readable while the game
> runs).* Tailing a legacy log mid-session gives stale/empty/partial results; do not infer "logging is off" from
> a quiet log file.

The two reliable live reads:

- **The `/computed` cache documents** — an on-demand snapshot via the game-thread mailbox; depends on no log file
  and no gate, and is the most reliable read for a POINT-IN-TIME value. ⚠ They are the ONLY data routes that
  answer; there is no `/state` surface today ([http-endpoints.md](specs/http-endpoints.md)).
- **`/events` SSE stream** — the gated `[TAG]` lines, live. DOMAIN facts stream unconditionally; DIAGNOSTIC/TRACE
  ride `gStreamLogLevel` (§2, §8). The per-turn lines burst at the **top of `doTurn`**, so you must **connect
  *before* the turn ticks** (connect-then-end-turn).
  - **⚠ Capture with an AUTO-RECONNECT loop, not a fixed-window curl.** `CvGame::doTurn` fires at the
    END of the inter-turn processing, which on a logged late-game turn can run **many minutes** — a fixed
    `curl -m 600` dies before the burst and the reconnect gap loses it.
    Capture with `while true; do curl -sN -m 3600 …/events >> capture.log; sleep 1; done` and grep the growing file.
  - **⚠ There are ≤ 8 concurrent stream slots** ([http-endpoints.md](specs/http-endpoints.md)) — a capture loop
    left running, or one that respawns `curl` in a `while` loop, holds them; once exhausted the endpoint returns
    `503 {"error":"too many event streams"}` and your capture silently records NOTHING. Verify the first frames
    are `event: hello` and not that error, and kill every loop when done — an empty capture reads exactly like
    "the feature did not fire."
  - **A force-killed game may lose the tail** — `taskkill /F` can drop OS-buffered log/burst lines written moments
    earlier. Post-mortem `Cascade.log` reads (legitimate once the process is dead) are only trustworthy for data
    older than the kill by a few seconds.
