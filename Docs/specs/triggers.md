# Triggers & grants — the provisions machine

> The cascade's **provisions** consumer: an `IEventConsumer` on the [event spine](../spine.md) that, on a
> `DOMAIN` state change, resolves the source entity's payload off its info and APPLIES it. The AUTHORING shapes are
> [json.md §5](json.md); this doc is the **machine** that consumes them.
>
> **⚖ TRIGGER IS THE TOP-LEVEL CONCEPT — A GRANT IS A TRIGGER WITH A NULL CONDITION (owner).** One plane, one

## ONE compiled plane — how `grants` and `triggers` meet

Both authoring shapes compile into the **same entry list** (`CvTriggers` on the info); there is no separate grants
section and no `m_grants` member anywhere. A `grants` block becomes ONE entry with `consideredAction = true`, no
condition and no roll — the degenerate trigger — and its payload lives in that entry exactly as an explicit
`action.grant` payload does. The considered-action entry is an O(1) read (its index captured at parse, never
searched for).

⚑ The implicit happening is a compiled FLAG, not an `on*` token: it is never authored, so there is no token to
collide with, and the dispatching event already names which considered action it is — a building's construction, a
tech's research, a civic's adoption.

⛔ **The ODDS are data; the ROLL is not.** A trigger authors a `chance` — a plain number — and the engine compares
its own draw against it. That draw comes off the SYNCHRONIZED stream, which is shared save state, so no JSON
authors a seed, a stream or a draw and neither the cascade nor the curator models one
([the synchronized RNG is shared state](../reference/engine.md#-the-synchronized-rng-is-shared-save-state--do-not-touch-the-draws-owner)).

## ⛔ A GRANTED ENTITY IS AN ORDINARY ENTITY (owner)

*"The only difference between a building granted and a building constructed is that we didn't use production if
granted."* So the machine gets **no** parallel apply path, no "granted" flag, no distinct lifecycle, no ledger of
its own: it places the entity through the **SAME creation mechanism** as normal creation, and the ONLY divergence
is that the production/cost step is skipped. Settled by this, not open:

- **A grant fires the ordinary DOMAIN events** — *"like anything else"* — so the enabler, the modifier packages and
  the tally see a granted building exactly as they see a constructed one. The machine FEEDS the spine; it never
  bypasses it ([spine.md](../spine.md): the spine is the SINGLE place a state change is announced).
- **A granted building runs its own first-build block**, because a construct would. The resulting grant→event→grant
  chain is intended behaviour, not re-entrancy to guard against.
- **Nothing downstream may branch on "was this granted?"** — there is no such state to read.

> **⛔ AND IT BINDS UNITS EXACTLY AS IT BINDS BUILDINGS — GRANT AND TRAIN ARE ONE PATH (owner): *"creating a unit
> is creating a unit; how we got to the creation step does not matter."*** The route by which a unit was decided
> upon — a production order, a trigger payload, a first-discoverer award, a founder package — ends at the SAME

> ⚑ **The tell that the rule is being broken is a DIVERGENT SIDE-EFFECT SET, not a divergent call**: the same

> ⚖ **IT IS THE PLAYER'S, NOT THE CITY'S, AND THE TELL IS WORTH KEEPING (owner).** The player OWNS units, and

> ⚠ **MOVEMENT is deliberately NOT settled there**, and that is a distinction to keep: the engine has two

> ⚑ **WHICH UNITS ARE OWED THE CITY'S EXPERIENCE IS DATA, NOT A CARVE-OUT HERE.** `addProductionExperience`
> gates on `canAcquirePromotionAny()`, and a unit the data declares `unpromotable` ([tags.md](tags.md)) answers
> false — so a great person born in a city takes none, without the step carrying an exception for it. ⛔ Do not
> re-add one: if some unit is taking experience it should not, the defect is its TAG, not this step.
> ⚠ **Measured, and the reason the step exists:** three creation shapes had disagreed — the property spawn called
> `addProductionExperience`, the religion founder's free units did not, and the first-discoverer leg went through
> `createGreatPeople`. A unit's starting experience therefore depended on which payload created it, which is
> exactly the "downstream can tell it was granted" state the ruling says must not exist.
> ⛔ **A SCHEDULED REWORK IS NOT A REASON TO STAY OFF THE STEP (owner).** The outcome system's ground-up rework,
> and the events carve-out, bound what may be REDESIGNED and what may be folded into this machine — neither

> **⛔ A SECOND WAY TO CREATE A UNIT IS A ROLLERSKATING SURFACE — AND THE MODDER-FACING ONE MOST OF ALL

> ⚑ **"Unified" means STANDARDIZED PATHS, not merely few of them (owner)** — the point is that a reader looking

> ⛔ So a scope boundary is never a reason to keep a creation call off the step: an ARRIVAL created anywhere —
> a combat CAPTURE, an espionage BRIBE, an advanced-start placement, a field spawn — goes through it.
>
> ⚖ **AND THE TRANSFORMATIONS GET THEIR OWN TWIN — `modifyUnit`, in the same vein (owner).** A unit that
> ALREADY EXISTS changing type, owner or count is not a creation: upgrade · gift · trade · merge / split (and
> their `CvMessageData` net twins) · `assimilatePlayer` · the map transfer. Each stands a successor up in place

## ⛔ THE MACHINE REPLACES THE PER-TURN WORK — and the spine is its ONLY way in (owner)

It is not a resolver running beside legacy: the per-turn work MOVES onto the machine, and the legacy call sites are
DELETED, not re-pointed. Their ledgers become derived and are cut by
[the uniform legacy-accumulator cut](../cascade.md#-the-legacy-accumulator-cut--every-accumulator-one-uniform-mechanism) via the `savemigration.txt`
soft-remove ([save.md §3](save.md)) — never a `@SAVEBREAK`.

⛔ **The per-turn apply arrives as a spine EVENT, never a direct call from `doTurn`.** The machine is an
`IEventConsumer` and that is its only front door; a machine taking events through `onEvent` *and* per-turn work
through a bespoke entry point has two front doors, which is the scattered-endpoint disease it exists to cure. The
player-scoped turn event is the natural grain — legacy ran the per-turn work inside the city loop within the
player's turn, so consuming the player boundary and walking that player's cities preserves the ordering.

**Perf constraint:** it must NOT re-create a per-city list of pending provisions (that list is the ledger being
deleted). It gates on the enabler's already-maintained **operating-building set**
([enabler.md §3.2](enabler.md)) — required for correctness anyway, since a dormant building must grant nothing.

⛔ **It never reads the legacy collapse members**, which LOSE `interval`/`enabled`/`chance` at map time. It reads
the composed entries, which carry the full structure. Never widen a legacy member to carry the missing fields.

## Registration order — the machine registers LAST

After the contexts, the enabler and the modifier: it READS the contexts (every entry condition evaluates through
the fill seams) and the enabler's operating set (a dormant building grants nothing), and unlike those machines it
**APPLIES** — so a stale read hands out a wrong GRANT, not merely a wrong number.

⚠ Every eval context it builds must be filled through the ONE seam AND wired with the enabler's operating set. The
enabler's precomputed sets are the THIRD LEG of the eval state, fed in rather than re-derived; without them the
operating-set legs sit EMPTY and any condition asking an active-building or vicinity-provides question evaluates
against nothing and quietly answers false.

> **⚖ A THRESHOLD ON A HAPPENING IS A TRIGGER, NOT A MAGNITUDE — the `techShare` worked case (owner).** Tech
> sharing reads as a diplomacy number and is not one: *"if 2 civs have the tech, then whoever has the wonder also
> gets the tech."* The `2` is not an amount anything accumulates — it is the **fire condition of an
> `onTechResearched` trigger** whose action grants the tech. So it authors on this plane
> (`trigger` → `chance` → `action`), never as a `diplomacy.<scope>.techShare` deposit, and it carries **no kind**
> — the same standing as the rest of the trigger-plane set (`survivor`, `cityCapture`, `combat.subdueAnimal`,
> `combat.nukeInterception`), which `CvInfoKinds.h` keeps deliberately unkinded pending this re-home.
> ⚑ **The TELL that generalizes** — and it is worth applying to every remaining family member: a number whose
> value is a **COUNT OF OTHER PARTIES / a threshold that decides WHETHER something happens** is a trigger
> condition; a number that is **added, scaled or stacked** is a modifier. `techShare: 2` never combines with
> another `techShare`, which is the giveaway that no channel was ever involved.
> **The condition form, settled:** `{type: TECH_X, scope: world, min: N}` — the world tech count
> ([tally.md](tally.md)), evaluated on the tech-acquired happening, with the action granting that tech.
> ⚖ **The legacy `isHasMet` filter is DROPPED (owner):** `CvTeam::updateTechShare` counted only teams you had
> MET, and the world count does not — *"it happens sufficiently late in the game that you have normally met all
> players."* An intentional, owner-ruled divergence, stated rather than reproduced
> ([validation.md](validation.md): the spec leads).
> ⚑ **And it is RE-ADDABLE, not lost (owner): *"if we want the met part, we put that in after the fact."*** It
> comes back as an ordinary CONDITION on the entry — a met predicate — which *extends* the vocabulary rather than
> reshaping anything ([conditions are predicates, never bespoke members](json.md#35-predicates--a-systems-runtime-state-query):
> the predicate registry is extensible by design). ⛔ So do NOT preserve the legacy filter now "to keep the option
> open" — the option is open by construction, and keeping it is the half-migration.
> ⚠ Two residues of that swap, both harmless but worth knowing rather than rediscovering: the world count is over
> **EVER-alive** teams, so a dead civ's tech still counts toward the threshold; and it does not exclude the asking
> team, which is inert here because the trigger only fires for a tech you do NOT hold.

> ⛔ Its consumer stays DANGLING until the re-home lands — do not restore it by minting or keeping a kind.

## ⛔ Purely-Python, never-XML effects are out of scope for this data model — but out of scope is not their destination

⚖ **They move to C++ after the rework, and most of them are triggers (owner): *"all these scripts is something we
will port to C++ after rework is done; having scripts like this in Python is root of all evil"* — *"most of it
can even be expressed as triggers."*** The gameplay scripts in `CvEventManager` and the contrib mods (the
per-wonder combat and turn effects, the combat-promotion mod, the respawn and revive handouts) are
**trigger-SHAPED by construction**: a happening, a chance, an action (this doc) — which is the same plane
`CvEventReporter`'s successor already lands on ([patterns.md](../architecture/patterns.md): events move INTO
C++, but that is a separate, later effort).

A KEEP-WORKING repair on one of these — re-pointing a handler onto the id surface — holds a mechanic alive until
its trigger exists; it is never an investment in the Python expression of it. Do the minimum that makes it work,
and do not improve, restructure or extend the script while in there.

⚠ **Do not start the port opportunistically.** Authoring one of these as a trigger needs its happening and its
verb to exist, and minting either speculatively for one mechanic is banned outright (§ What the plane must NOT
do, below). This data model migrates the **XML-dealt-with surface** (XML data + the engine machinery that reads
it). Gameplay living ONLY in Python that reads NO XML field is a separate surface this model never touches — the
hardcoded per-turn wonder spawns/grants in `CvEventManager`, and effects that are structurally INEXPRESSIBLE in
the model (a culture burst when a unit dies has no home in the `grants`/modifier/enabler vocabulary, which
declares provisions on standard triggers, not arbitrary event reactions). ⚑ Their absence from any migration
inventory is the scope boundary working, not a gap — and there is **no exposure by construction**: the grants
machine applies only what is in the XML-derived JSON, so an effect that was never in XML never enters the JSON
and can never double-up or be lost.

## What the plane must NOT do

- ⛔ **The per-turn applier must NOT apply property pulses.** Their carriers bridge theirs at load; applying them
  again would double the value AND land it outside the solver's ordered pass, where spread resolves against
  PRE-source values ([engine.md](../reference/engine.md)) — and that engine's math is owner-LOCKED.
- ⛔ **Do not build machinery for a hypothetical verb.** A verb with zero authorings is an EXAMPLE in the spec, not
  live data; it lands if and when its authoring direction is taken.
  ⚑ **The worked case — building counter-damage (owner): IF WE WANT IT, IT IS A TRIGGER; UNTIL THEN IT IS
  NOTHING.** A trap building damaging a unit that attacks its city is a trigger by shape — a happening, a roll,
  an effect on the attacker. Modelling it needs an **`onAttacked`** happening and a **`damage`** verb, neither of
  which exists. The ruling takes neither of the two tempting shortcuts: the verbs are NOT minted speculatively for
  one mechanic, and the legacy member is NOT kept alive in the meantime — **the data goes out and the mechanic is
  authored fresh when the rework is taken.** ⚠ So being trigger-SHAPED is not on its own a reason to re-home
  something, and it is equally not a reason to preserve the old shape while waiting: a member parked on the
  `defense` family is a half-migration that reads as done. *(The UNIT-side trap subsystem is separately dead —
  [skills.md](skills.md).)*
- ⚠ **A promotion that stops being valid is dropped by the PROMOTION SYSTEM itself** (owner). So a granted
  promotion needs no take-away verb, and "the payload plane cannot revoke" is NOT an argument for re-homing the
  free-promotion shapes.

## ⛔ A DROPPED TRIGGER ANNOUNCES — every skip goes through the ONE census

**If a trigger fails to parse or to land, say so** (owner). The plane is fail-closed in several places — the bridge
refuses a source it cannot faithfully translate rather than applying it under a wrong condition, and the parser
refuses malformed input — and being fail-closed is right. Being fail-closed *and silent* is not: authored data that
loads, never applies, and reports nothing is invisible on both axes at once.

Every drop routes through the ONE load-time census
([the DRY single-implementation law](../architecture/patterns.md#dry--one-implementation-per-calculation--evaluation-the-single-source-law)) — the same mechanism the
parser already uses for unknown verbs and keys, surfacing on readJson's coverage counts. ⛔ Do NOT add a second
reporting path or a bespoke spine domain for this.

⚑ The case that was genuinely invisible: a conditioned pulse whose condition falls outside the bridge's known
predicate set, dropped with nothing said. What the census reports is a real question to ASK of a loaded game.

---

## Game-start provisions — START PACKAGES

The game-start sequence (what a player begins the game holding) is a set of JSON-authored **start packages** the
machine applies, replacing the hardcoded engine selection. Owner intent: *"this gives modders a chance to set up
how they want."*

**The problem it solves.** Today the start is split between data and hardcoded engine logic, and the engine half is
the problem: the COUNTS are curated, but the **unit identity is not authored anywhere** — it is picked at runtime by
scanning the whole unit database, filtering on trainability and scoring with an AI valuation — and the **settler is
not in data at all**. A modder therefore cannot say what a start looks like; they can only nudge counts and hope the
scorer picks the unit they meant.

A start package is an ordinary entity — one JSON object per file — essentially a named `grants` block plus the
condition that decides when it applies:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "STARTPACKAGE_ANCIENT_DEFAULT",
  "enabled": { "type": "ERA", "max": 1 },          // the ordinary entity-level gate
  "grants": {
    "units": [ { "unit": "UNIT_SETTLER", "count": 1 },
               { "unit": "UNIT_BRUTE",   "count": 2 } ],
    "startingGold": 40
  }
}
```

- **Reuses `grants` wholesale** — no parallel vocabulary ([json.md §5](json.md)).
- **The settler stops being hardcoded** — it is just a `units` entry.
- The per-role starting counts are superseded by explicit unit entries.

> **⚖ THE POINT: author the shared start ONCE, not per civilization (owner).** `grants` can already express a start,
> but putting it on the CIVILIZATION means repeating the same block with the same conditionals across ~50 civ files
> that all start identically — *"kinda dumb, when it's the same package for all of them."* A package inverts that:
> **the condition lives ON THE PACKAGE, evaluated once**, and every civ it applies to gets it without authoring
> anything. A civilization authors something only when it DEVIATES, and that deviation is its own package stacking
> on top of the shared default.

**Packages STACK (owner).** Applicable packages sum, exactly like any other grants deposit — they are not mutually
exclusive alternatives. Stacking SUBSUMES single-selection, so the modder chooses the granularity: one coherent
package, or era + handicap + civilization composing. Single-selection could not express the second, and the engine
already adds era + handicap counts today, so stacking is the behaviour-preserving choice as well as the flexible one.

⛔ **"Conditionally loaded" means the ENTITY GATE, never a load-time prune.** The applicability condition is the
entity-level `enabled`/`disabled` pair evaluated LIVE ([the whole-entity applicability gate](json.md#2-anatomy-of-an-entity)).
Do NOT build a "load these files, skip those" prune — that is the killed `loadPrune`
([superseded-ideas](../architecture/superseded-ideas.md) #3). Every package loads; the gate decides which APPLY.

**What a new entity type requires** (skipping any of these is how an entity ends up half-wired): a folder under
`Assets/Data/`, one object per file · the `STARTPACKAGE_` infotype prefix registered in [naming.md](naming.md) · a
row in the ONE per-type repo dispatch (which earns it the full-registry re-map, the DepositIndex push, and an
info-repo home) · an `_order.json` manifest · and authoring through `_additions`, since entity curation is
complete and there is no legacy XML to convert — the unit identities never existed as data.

## Free promotions — TWO SOURCES, one relation

A city's OPERATING BUILDINGS and the unit owner's HELD TRAITS both arm units, and they author the identical
shape, so the plane carries no trait-specific payload — only a different owner and a different leg (2).

|  | the source is | leg (1) unit arrives | leg (2) source arrives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **building** | the CITY's, active per the operating set | walk the city's active buildings | `SEVT_CITY_BUILDING_ACTIVATED` — that city's units |
| **trait** | the UNIT OWNER's, held per the empire | walk the owner's held traits | `SEVT_EMPIRE_TRAIT_ADDED` — that empire's units, over all its cities |

⚠ **The owner axis differs and the difference is load-bearing:** a same-team ally's unit standing in your city
is armed by your BUILDING (the city arms whoever it shelters) and by its OWN empire's traits — never by yours.
So the building leg filters on TEAM and the trait leg on the unit's OWNER; using one filter for both silently
hands your traits to a teammate.

⛔ **Do NOT answer a dangling trait promotion by restoring a trait-side promotion × unitcombat map** — that is
the legacy mechanism whose data moved, and it swept the whole trait registry per promotion to do it. The trait
legs of `CvUnit::setFreePromotion` are gone deliberately.

⚑ **A trait is EMPIRE-scoped while this happening is a CITY relation, and that is the authored model, not an
oversight:** a trait's promotions reach a unit that is in one of the empire's cities. In practice that is every
unit at birth (creation runs the same applier) and every unit that ever passes through one; a promotion once
handed over is permanent, so nothing has to hold the unit there. The re-fire is free — the applier skips a
promotion the unit already holds.
