# Vision — "how far can I see?"

How far an observer sees, and what stops them. **Vision works the way movement works** (owner): a budget spent
walking outward, where open ground costs 1 and difficult ground costs more. A sight of N sees N plots of open
ground, and fewer through anything costlier.

**Vision is ONE family** — `vision` — with three kinds and the scope axis
([scope is a separate axis, never folded into the kind](../architecture/patterns.md#the-coherent-surface--grouped-storage-parameterized-getters-owner-clarity-and-predictability-is-king)) saying whose is whose. It had no spec
until now, which is exactly why it had no family: each curator invented a shape, and `seeFrom` / `seeThrough` /
`visibilityRange` ended up as three names sliding between the same two ideas.

---

## 1. One family, three kinds

| kind | means | authored on |
|---|---|---|
| **strength** (memberless) | how well an OBSERVER sees | unit · promotion |
| **`elevation`** | how **high** something is, which grants sight to whoever looks from it | terrain · improvement (plot) · building (its city) |
| **`obstruction`** | what the GROUND costs to see **through** | terrain · feature · route |

⛔ **`elevation` and `obstruction` are KINDS inside `vision`, never families of their own.** They are what vision
is *made of* — the same relationship `defense` has to `bombardDefense`, or `movement` to `moveDiscount` — and
splitting them out would scatter one mechanic across three families to no end.

**Where each observer's sight comes from:**

- **A unit's vision STRENGTH is exclusively its own base stat plus its promotions** (owner) — no other source
  raises it. Its **elevation** then comes from the ground it stands on, which is what a hill or a watchtower is
  for. Strength travels with the unit; elevation belongs to the place.
- **A city's elevation is what its BUILDINGS raise** — a tree platform puts the lookout a storey up. The deposit
  is **city-scoped**, and that is not a detail: ⛔ *a building by its very definition cannot add elevation to a
  unit that moves* (owner). It elevates the fixed observer it belongs to and transfers to nobody passing through,
  which is precisely what distinguishes it from an improvement on the same plot.
- **A city's base STRENGTH is engine config, not authored data: the `CITY_VISIBILITY_RANGE` global define**,
  written in PLOTS and lifted to the scale at the read (the `MAX_UNIT_VISIBILITY_RANGE` shape). No data authors a
  memberless `vision.city` strength — every city sees the same base, and buildings differentiate via elevation.
- **⛔ A CITY'S RING IS BOUGHT BY THE BUDGET, NEVER GUARANTEED PAST IT (owner): "a guaranteed innermost vision
  feels wrong — this should be modelled by a default elevation increase and sight strength."** A settlement
  stands tall by construction, so beside its base strength (`CITY_VISIBILITY_RANGE`) every city carries a
  DEFAULT ELEVATION (`CITY_BASE_ELEVATION`, plots, lifted at the read like its sibling); buildings raise the
  elevation further through the channel. The combined budget is what keeps the earliest city's innermost ring
  visible through ordinary obstruction — through the walk, with no bypass, so an extreme obstruction may still
  legitimately blind it.
- **⛔ A city REGISTERS ITS OWN TEAM'S SIGHT like any other observer.** The inherited city block registered only
  vassal / espionage / embassy viewers — legacy leaned on the owned-plot leg's RANGE semantics to light the
  owner's ring, which the budget walk deliberately does not reproduce — so `CvPlot::updateSight`'s city leg
  carries the own-team condition first.
- **⛔ A FOREIGN VIEWER SEES THE CITY, NEVER *FROM* THE CITY (owner).** Espionage, embassy and vassal city
  visibility register the city PLOT alone — a ZERO budget, which collapses the walk's box to the origin — never
  the city's own observer budget: a watcher must not inherit the watched city's eyes and see into the lands
  around it.

> **⚖ `elevation`, never "vantage" (owner).** The plain-English word wins: not every reader knows "vantage", and a
> name nobody has to look up beats a precise one that some do.

---

## 1a. THE SCALE — one plot of open ground costs 100

**A baseline of 1 is too low** (owner), and the shipped data shows exactly what it cost: **all 78
obstruction-authoring features carried the identical `1`**, because there was no value between "free" and
"twice as expensive" — forest simply could not be made cheaper than jungle. One plot now costs **100**, the same
"one step = 100" denominator movement already uses, so both families read alike and there is room to say what
you mean.

| quantity | value | reads as |
|---|--:|---|
| open ground — the baseline | **100** | one plot |
| jungle / forest obstruction | +100 | costs 2 plots to see through |
| hills elevation | +100 | one plot |
| peak elevation | +300 | three plots |
| a unit's base sight | 200 | sees 2 plots |
| a sharpening promotion | +25 … +100 | a quarter plot to a full one |

⛔ **ONE SCALE, ALWAYS.** Movement fractured into two — terrain in whole moves, routes in denominator units —
because its baseline could not express a part-step. Vision inherits no such split and must never grow one.

⚑ **A modder writes the sensible number and nothing else** (owner). `100` is the authored value; readJson's
×100 conversion at the boundary is none of their business, and that the engine then works in 10,000 has no real
consequence. Anything finer than a hundredth of a plot authors `0.5` and the fixed point carries it — so there
is never a reason to invent a second unit.

---

## 2. The formula

```
sight       = Σ vision.<observerScope>.flat  +  elevationAt(O)
cost(p)     = Σ vision.plot.obstruction.flat  on p           (open ground = 1)

  elevationAt(a unit) = Σ vision.plot.elevation.flat  on the plot it is STANDING ON
  elevationAt(a city) = Σ vision.city.elevation.flat  on that city

visible(T)  ⟺  Σ cost(p)  over p on the straight line O → T, excluding O AND T  <  sight
```

**⚖ THE SPEND MIRRORS MOVEMENT EXACTLY (owner): a positive REMAINDER reaches the next plot** — as a unit with
a fraction of a move left still enters an expensive tile. A plot is seen on the budget left BEFORE its own cost
is charged; the charge then gates seeing PAST it. Two things fall out for free: any ADJACENT plot is visible to
any observer with a positive budget (no intervening plot to charge — a city's innermost ring needs no
guarantee), and "into the jungle, not past it" is the charge doing its one job.

⚑ **Elevation is POSITIONAL, never carried** (owner): a peak has 2 elevation, so a unit standing on the peak has
2 — *and only while on that plot*. Step off and it is gone. That is what makes elevation the ground's property
rather than the unit's, and why it is authored on the GROUND rather than on whoever stands there: the peak is 2
high whether or not anyone is looking at it.

All values are ×100 fixed point internally and human in JSON like every other channel
([the ×100 fixed-point model](curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries)) — an author writes `1`, `1.5`, `2`, so
fractional obstruction needs no new scale.

**What the formula gives, by construction:**

- Open ground everywhere ⇒ every `cost` is 1 ⇒ the sum out to distance *d* is *d* ⇒ **sight 1 sees 1 plot,
  sight 2 sees 2**, and so on.
- A jungle costing 2 eats two plots of budget, so an observer sees INTO it and not past it — you always see the
  obstruction itself, never through it.
- An observer's own plot is free: you are not charged to see where you stand.

⛔ **The walk is the STRAIGHT LINE, not the cheapest path — the one place the movement mirror deliberately
breaks.** Movement may route around a mountain; vision must not, because routing around is exactly what would let
you see behind it. The SPEND itself mirrors movement fully (the remainder rule above); only the routing differs.

### Why STRENGTH and ELEVATION stay two channels

Both add budget, so they are interchangeable currencies against obstruction — and that IS the mechanic (owner):
**a jungle demands extra strength, and you may pay it either by seeing better (a hunter's promotion) or by
standing above it (elevation).** Two routes to the same view is the design, not a redundancy to collapse.

They stay two channels because they answer different questions — **strength is how well you see, elevation is how
high you stand** — and the difference is where the room is. A spyglass is strength; a tower is elevation. Keeping
them apart now means a later rule that treats them *unlike* (elevation weighed against an obstruction's own
height, so height sees OVER what strength must see THROUGH) needs no re-authoring. ⚑ The 1:1 sum is the SIMPLE
rule, not the final word.

---

## 3. Worked authoring

```jsonc
// a jungle: one extra plot's worth to see through, so it costs 2 plots in all
"vision": { "plot": { "obstruction": { "flat": 100 } } }

// a peak: three plots of elevation to stand on
"vision": { "plot": { "elevation": { "flat": 300 } } }

// a watchtower improvement: raises whoever stands here by a plot
"vision": { "plot": { "elevation": { "flat": 100 } } }

// a unit's own sight, and a promotion sharpening it
"vision": { "unit": { "flat": 200 } }

// tree platforms: the city's lookout goes up a storey
"vision": { "city": { "elevation": { "flat": 100 } } }
```

Ground that authors no `vision.plot.obstruction` costs the open-ground default — **absent means ordinary**, never a special
case to encode.

## 4. HIDE AND SEEK — the intent, written down

> **⛔ MEMBERSHIP IS ASKED BEFORE THE CONTEST, AND HOLDING THE METHOD SKILL *IS* THE MEMBERSHIP QUESTION.** A
> unit is hidden only by a method it actually hides BY, so `hasInvisibilityType(method)` asks whether the unit
> holds `GC.getMethodSkill(method)` and only then applies the negation filters. ⚠ This is the clause that
> carries the whole mechanic: the engine returns INVISIBLE for the first method no seer has registered against,
> **before** the graduated contest is reached — so a membership test that answers yes for every method makes
> every unit invisible to every foreign team, and no amount of authored detection can counter it.
> ⚑ The legacy engine got the same discrimination for free from its per-method `invisibilityIntensityTotal`,
> which the collapse to one method-agnostic `concealment` magnitude removed; the skill is what replaces it.
> ⛔ **The failure direction is FAIL-OPEN TOWARD INVISIBILITY**, which is why this is stated rather than left to

> produces no error, no wrong number and no log line.
>
> ⚠ **DETECTION IS KEYED BY SKILL ID, NEVER BY THE `INVISIBLE_*` INDEX.** `detectionAgainst` takes the method's
> SKILL, so a registration passing the index files a seer's detection under whichever method happens to share
> that number and reads 0 under the one it was authored for — silently, since `setSpotIntensity` stores nothing

>
> ⚑ **A PROMOTION-GRANTED METHOD REGISTERS THROUGH THE RESOLVED FOLD.** The membership test

> `noInvisibility` canceller skill rides the same fold.
> ⛔ **The CLASSIC method read stays the INFO's own datum** (§ the classic callout below): only a UNIT authors

> deriving it from the skill union is the border-patrol bug, never a gap to close.
>
> ⚑ **WHY THIS MATTERS MORE THAN TIDINESS — the mechanic is playable but not UNDERSTANDABLE (owner):**

### The rule the code never states

**ONE detection type counters ONE concealment type** (owner). It is a PAIRING, not a matrix and not a single
contest: a seeker's strength against submarines is weighed against a hider's submarine concealment, and against
nothing else.

The shipped data says so plainly once you know to look — the same key appears on both sides:

| side | carries | means |
|---|---|---|
| the hider | `invisible: INVISIBLE_SUBMARINE` | the METHOD it hides by |
| | `invisibilityIntensity: { INVISIBLE_SUBMARINE: n }` | how well it hides by that method |
| the seeker | `visibilityIntensity: { INVISIBLE_SUBMARINE: n }` | how well it answers that method |
| | `visibilityIntensityRange` | ⚠ a SECOND reach, parallel to vision's |
| | `visibilityIntensitySameTile` | a bonus at zero distance |

**The type IS the pairing.** Nothing in the engine says so, which is why it reads as an arbitrary pile of tables.

### What the data actually uses (measured, not assumed)

14 invisible types across 13 table keys, 477 authorings.

- **Magnitudes are genuinely graduated** — 1 … 26, plus ~100 NEGATIVE entries (counter-detection, something
  actively reducing what a seeker perceives). This texture is real and any redesign keeps it.
- **The per-type CROSS-PRODUCT is largely fiction** — **270 of 355 authoring entities name exactly ONE type**;
  only 10 name four or more, and `CAMOUFLAGE` / `SIZE` / `DISGUISED` are three quarters of everything. The
  14×13 surface serves a quarter of its own data.

### Where it lands — THE `hideAndSeek` BLOCK, never inside `vision`

⛔ **HIDE AND SEEK IS ITS OWN BLOCK AND ITS OWN EVALUATION (owner).** `vision` answers ONE question — *how far
do you see* — and stops there. Whether a unit standing inside that reach is PERCEIVED is a graduated CONTEST
between how well it hides and how well the seeker detects, which is a different mechanic with a different
evaluation. ⚑ **The separation is the deliverable, not tidiness: the legacy engine's hide-and-seek evaluation
bled into its classic-visibility evaluation for years** (owner), so the two must not be expressed in one family
where the same bleed can re-form. The contest data therefore lives in **`hideAndSeek`**, the option-gated block
([json.md §9](json.md): a dedicated system's data lives in its own block, and the module is ON iff that block
exists and is non-empty), and `vision` keeps only the budget — strength, `elevation`, `obstruction`.

> **⚖ THE CONTEST'S CARRIERS TODAY ARE UNITS, PROMOTIONS AND UNIT-COMBAT CLASSES (owner): no building shows
> hidden units, classically or in the contest — detection travels with seeker UNITS ("various kinds of
> dogs").** The absence is INHERITED DESIGN, not a data accident: vanilla Civ4 deliberately had no detection
> on buildings at all, which is why no building surface down the whole lineage ever carried one. So the block
> folds onto the UNIT's resolved plane and nowhere else today.
> ⚖ **A BUILDING-FED CITY PLANE IS UN-KILLED FORWARD INTENT, not a dead idea (owner): a scenario is wanted
> where buildings do it — a NEW mechanic, since legacy never had one — so the city must stay PREPARED for
> it.** When data authors a building `hideAndSeek` block, the city gains its own cached fold over its
> OPERATING buildings, marked on the building facts (the unit block's shape one scope over). ⛔ Until that
> data exists nothing is built (a shape with zero authorings is an example, not live data —
> [triggers.md](triggers.md)); a building authoring the block today surfaces on the readJson
> unconsumed-section census, which is the fail-loud signal that the wiring's moment has come.

> **⛔ VISIBILITY ITSELF IS NOT A SKILL, AND IS NOT MODELLED AS ONE BEYOND FILTERING (owner): *"if visibility was
> a skill it would only be absolute values, and hide and seek has gradient values."*** A skill is a pure boolean
> ENABLER ([json.md §8](json.md)) — it carries no value — so it can express WHICH method is in play and never HOW
> WELL. The contest is graduated on both sides, so the strength lives in `concealment` / `detection` and the skill
> plane is used **only as the membership filter**: which method a hider hides by, which method a seeker answers.
> ⛔ So do not model a visibility LEVEL as skills (a ladder of `camouflage1/2/3`, a per-tier key) — that re-encodes
> a magnitude in a plane that cannot hold one, which is exactly what the retired per-type intensity tables did
> ([superseded-ideas #35](../architecture/superseded-ideas.md)). ⚑ And it is why the membership test is the SKILL
> while the contest reads the magnitudes beside it — the two are not alternatives, they are the filter and the
> value.
>
> **⚖ ⇒ AND THEREFORE THE VISIBILITY AND HIDING VALUES ARE MODELLED THE SAME WAY NORMAL VISION IS, JUST WITH
> DIFFERENT PARAMETERS (owner).** That is the conclusion the gradient forces, not a separate preference: §1a's
> scale and §2's budget-against-cost shape already express a graduated quantity correctly, so `concealment` and
> `detection` are the same KIND of number as `sight` and `obstruction` — same ×100 fixed point, same

> ⛔ **So there is no bespoke intensity scale here, and none is to be invented.** A per-method 1…26 ladder is the
> legacy shape that died ([superseded-ideas #35](../architecture/superseded-ideas.md)); a fresh one would be the
> same mistake re-authored.
> ⚠ **What this does NOT reopen is the REACH** — detection still gets none of its own (§4 below), and "modelled
> like vision" is a statement about how the VALUES behave, never a licence to grow the second range system
> `visibilityIntensityRange` was retired for. The contest runs on the plot the §2 budget already granted.

⚖ **THE METHOD IS A SKILL, NOT A TAG (owner).** The operative test is *can a promotion grant it?*
([json.md §8](json.md)) — and it plainly can: **optical camouflage** is exactly a late-game promotion INTO a
hiding method. So the method is a [skill](skills.md), which fits on both counts: promotion-grantable, and a pure
boolean enabler carrying no value — correct, because the LEVEL is the `concealment` magnitude beside it.
⛔ It is NOT a [tag](tags.md), and the reason generalizes: a tag says what a unit **IS**, while `camouflage` /
`size` / `political` say how it **HIDES**. **`submarine` is the case that proves the split** — it is a genuine
identity tag AND carries the method skill, because a surfaced submarine is not hidden: *"submarine does not need
to be hidden/invisible, it just mostly is"* (owner).
⚑ **The tag reading also DESTROYED authored data, which is what settles it.** Tags are not promotion-grantable,
so a method named by a PROMOTION had nowhere to land and was dropped on the floor — and **73 promotions author
one** (`CAMOUFLAGE` 40 · `DISGUISED` 21 · `NAVAL_DISGUISE` 16 · `POLITICAL` 15 · `INVISIBLE` 10 · `SIZE` 9 ·
`CLOAKED` 8 · `SUBMARINE` 3), the cloaking line among them. A carrier that cannot hold what the data authors is
the wrong carrier.

```jsonc
// the hider: the METHOD is a skill (promotion-grantable), the LEVEL is a magnitude
"skills":      [ "camouflage" ],
"hideAndSeek": { "concealment": { "flat": 300 } }

// the seeker: sonar answers submarines well and camouflage poorly
"hideAndSeek": { "detection": [ { "value": 500, "unit": "HAS_SUBMARINE" },
                                { "value": 200, "unit": "HAS_CAMOUFLAGE" } ] }
```

A skill is something a unit **HAS**, so the qualifier reads `HAS_<SKILL>` ([json.md §3.5](json.md): `IS_*` is
what the target IS, `HAS_*` is what it has) — the same `{unit: …}` qualifier cargo uses, pointed at the skill
plane rather than the tag plane.

`perceived ⟺ reachable ∧ detection(against that method) ≥ concealment`

⛔ **Detection gets NO reach of its own (owner).** Reach is the §2 budget, already computed; the contest only
ever runs on a plot that budget already granted. That is what retires `visibilityIntensityRange` — a second
range system running beside vision's, with nothing keeping the two in step. Negatives need no mechanism either:
the block's entries sum, so counter-detection is a negative deposit.

### What survived the collapse

The legacy per-invisible-type table pair is retired — [superseded-ideas.md #35](../architecture/superseded-ideas.md).
**What survived is what the data used:** the 1:1 pairing, graduated strengths, and negatives as
counter-detection (the entries sum, so a negative deposit just subtracts). A promotion carries **both** — the
method skill it grants, and the magnitudes it adds — which is precisely what the tag reading could not express.

⛔ **The CLASSIC system keeps its own datum — `hideAndSeek.method` — and the contest never reads it.** Legacy
carried TWO invisibility planes: the single `<Invisible>` tag (what the classic branch reads with the option
OFF) and the intensity tables (the contest's ancestor). The method-skill SET is the contest's membership and
deliberately wider than the classic plane — a robber contests by disguise and politics yet authors no classic
tag, i.e. it was **never classically invisible at all**. Deriving the classic method from the skill union
therefore made the whole contest-only population classically invisible for the first time ever (border patrols
stopped killing criminals — the live find that forced this datum). The curator emits `method` from the single
tag alone; absent means classically never-invisible ([json.md §9](json.md)).

## 5. What this model retires

The legacy engine expressed one idea with two unrelated number systems: a **radius**
(`visibilityRange = 1 + terrainElevation + extraVisibility + improvement.visibilityChange`, clamped) and an
**elevation tier** compared per step (`seeFromLevel` against `seeThroughLevel`). Both collapse into the single
budget above, and the `seeFrom` / `seeThrough` / `visibilityRange` members go with them — a feature's
see-through value IS its obstruction, an improvement's see-from IS its elevation.

`MAX_UNIT_VISIBILITY_RANGE` survives as a plain clamp on `sight`. Nothing else of the old shape does.
