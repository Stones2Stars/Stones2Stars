# JSON data spec — the authoritative entity shape & vocabulary

The single source of truth for what a Stones2Stars data file may **contain**. Every game entity — a building,
unit, tech, civic, religion, terrain, … — is **one JSON object in its own file** under `Assets/Data/<type>/`.
The three **cascade** machines — the engine systems that read this data: [enabler](enabler.md) ("can I build
it?"), [modifier](../cascade.md) ("how much?"), [tally](tally.md) ("how many?") — plus `readJson` consume exactly
this shape; the future modder reference is *derived* from this spec, never the other way round.

**The one promise — the data reads cold.** A well-authored file is understandable with zero engine knowledge.
Keys say what they mean; values say what they are. If a shape only makes sense once you know the C++, it is
wrong — the engine is built to fit the data.

> **Validate while you author.** `readjson.exe Assets/Data --render BUILDING_FORGE` parses a file, flags anything
> unrecognized, and renders it to plain English (*"Forge: +25% production; +1 happiness while powered; unlocks
> Crossbowman"*) so you can check "is this what I meant?".

## 1. The big picture

An entity's JSON is a **flat set of top-level keys**. Each key is exactly one of two things:

- a **reserved section** — a fixed keyword with a defined meaning (`enables`, `requires`, `allowed`, `grants`,
  `identity`, `cost`, …); or
- a **modifier family** — a per-turn effect this entity produces (`food`, `production`, `happiness`,
  `maintenance`, one per `PROPERTY_*`, …).

**The classification rule (deterministic, parser-enforced):** a non-reserved top-level key whose value is an
**object** is a **modifier family** (it is scope-keyed, §6); a non-reserved key whose value is a **bare**
bool/string/number is a **capability/skill flag or a text field**, never a family. So the *value's shape* decides
"family vs flag," and a *section's name* decides its meaning. A family colliding with a reserved word is an error.

Everything below is detail under one idea: **one object structure, one shared vocabulary, composed everywhere.**

The three machines read only the **cascade** sections (`enables`-family, `requires`, the modifier families, the
count-bearing clauses, `grants`); intrinsic and auxiliary sections feed their own systems. `readJson` parses all
of them.

## 2. Anatomy of an entity

| group | sections | what they are |
|---|---|---|
| **Availability** | `enables` · `obsoletes` · `replaces` · `disables` · `requires` · `allowed` | what this unlocks/removes; what it needs to be built & to keep running; the cap on how many may exist |
| **Provisions** | `grants` · `triggers` · `provides` | `grants` = pure payload on the source's considered action; `triggers` = trigger → chance → action (happening-fired / rolled / state-conditioned effects); `provides` = a continuous in-vicinity SUPPLY while active (e.g. a building or map bonus that makes a `BONUS_*` available in the city) |
| **Effects** | every **modifier family** key (`food`, `production`, `happiness`, …, one per `PROPERTY_*`) | per-turn magnitudes this deposits onto targets |
| **Trade routes** | `tradeRoutes` | **its own BASE SECTION** — the route COUNTS and the modifiers TO routes, together (owner). See below |
| **Intrinsic** ("what am I") | `identity` (incl. all TEXT) · `cost` · `ui` · `world` · `sound` · `ai` | empire-agnostic self-description, art, audio, AI metadata |
| **Classification** | `skills` (UNIT, mutable abilities) · `tags` (UNIT, immutable type membership) · `status` (UNIT, a per-turn counter -- applied, ticks down, over) · `attributes` (BUILDING, what the building itself is/does) · `amenities` (CITY-held, grantor-provided) · `characteristics` (PLOT SUBSTRATE, held plot-scope intrinsics) · `capabilities` (TEAM, grantor-provided) | §8 — the classification model; scope carried by the section name |
| **Applicability** | entity-level `enabled` · `disabled` | the whole entity applies only while `enabled` holds and `disabled` does not (the §3.9 pair at entity level) — the canonical whole-entity game-option gate: `"enabled": "GAMEOPTION_X"` |
| **Auxiliary / bespoke** | `policies` · `excludes` · `produces` · `condition` · `effect` · `outcomes` · `mapGeneration` · `replacedBy` · `promotionLine` · `buildUp` · `shrine` · `headquarters` · `properties` · `voteSource` · `threshold` · `role` · `victory` · `targetLevel` · `conversion` · `unitCapability` · `canTrade` (tech → the trade-table/deal system: tradeable items + agreements — `techs`/`openBorders`/`rightOfPassage`/`embassy`/`bonuses`/…) · `canTradeOn` (tech → trade-route system; terrain refs) · `canWorkOn` (tech → the city `canWork` gate; workable plot classes — `water`/`peaks`/…) — all three [capabilities.md](capabilities.md) | data read by their own systems, not the cascade |

`type` (the entity's own id, e.g. `"BUILDING_FORGE"`) and the TEXT fields are present where relevant.

> **⚖ `tradeRoutes` IS ITS OWN BASE SECTION — the COUNTS and the MODIFIERS TO ROUTES live together in it (owner).**
> *"Trade route counts, and the modifier to trade routes, should be in the base, because trade routes
> fundamentally is its own section."*
>
> ⛔ **A per-yield trade modifier is NOT a member of the yield family** — a trait reducing a route's food authors
> under `tradeRoutes`, never `food.<scope>.tradeRoute` — the yield families carry what an entity DEPOSITS, and
> "what a route is worth" is a property of the route, not of food.
> ⚑ Getting this wrong is silent: an unkinded member parses, logs once as `[READJSON] unkinded-member
> <family>.<member>`, and produces NOTHING — the trade-route per-yield and `coastal`/`foreign` variants bite
> hardest here.
>
> ⚖ **Two axes, neither the other's member:** the **COUNT** axis (how many routes, and the cap) and the
> **MODIFIER** axis (the route-PROFIT percentage by route kind, plus the per-channel percentage on the yield a
> route delivers). ⛔ **Route KIND is a CONDITION, never a kind of its own** —
> `coastal`/`foreign`/`sharedCivic` are predicates on the entry ([§3.5](#35-predicates--a-systems-runtime-state-query)):
> `IS_FOREIGN`/`SHARES_CIVIC` evaluate against the route's partner city. ⚠ Not the same predicate shape:
> `coastal` is a verdict about the CITY; `foreign`/`sharedCivic` about the ROUTE.
>
> **⛔ WHY ITS OWN SECTION (owner): trade routes are an isolated system we don't fully control, so we feed it
> what we have BEFORE it reaches base.** The engine owns the network calculation (which cities pair, what a route
> is worth) and the cascade cannot re-derive it; the cascade owns only the INPUTS, assembled as one complete
> package before the engine runs, because afterwards there is nothing left to attach them to. ⇒ That is what
> makes it a SECTION rather than a family — a modifier family deposits into a scope's package and is read at
> combine; this one has to be COMPLETE at a specific upstream moment.
> ⚑ **A route therefore takes percentages TWICE, which is not double-counting (owner):** once on the route itself
> (profit + per-channel, inside the engine stage), again when the yield lands in the city's TIER-1 BASE and takes
> the ordinary percent stack ([modifier.md §2a](../cascade.md)) — the same two-stack shape a SPECIALIST's own
> percent layer uses before joining BASE. ⚠ A trade-route modifier authored anywhere else arrives too late to
> reach the system that consumes it.

## 3. The shared vocabulary

The same atoms compose `requires`, the `enabled`/`disabled` conditions, the `per` count-scalers, `grants`, and
modifier targets — **not separate shapes.** Learn them once.

### 3.1 Types, tokens, `SELF`

- **Data Types** — `INFOTYPE_NAME` ids (`BONUS_COAL`, `UNIT_AXEMAN`, `BUILDING_FORGE`). The leading **infotype**
  prefix identifies the kind and routes the reference; the full prefix glossary (`UNIT_` = unit, `TRAIT_` =
  simple trait, `TRAIT_COMPLEX_` = complex, …) is the **[naming spec](naming.md)**.
- **Catch-all tokens** — engine concepts that aren't data Types: `TURN`, `POPULATION`, `MILITARY`, `CITY`,
  `TEAM`, `UNIT_LEVEL`, `AREA_SIZE`, **`ERA`** (the player's current era as a plain **counter 1…X** — the era
  sequence; eras are ordered data defined in `Assets/Data/eras/`), **the commerce slider rates** `GOLD_RATE` /
  `RESEARCH_RATE` / `CULTURE_RATE` / `ESPIONAGE_RATE` (the player's current slider percents as plain counters —
  a wellbeing deposit per-scaled on one is "happiness per 10% culture rate" / "anger per gold rate"),
  **`CULTURE_PERCENTAGE`** (the city's OWN-culture percent of its plot — the city-scope culture-share driver;
  foreign share authors as the `100 −` telescoping pair, never an inverse unit),
  **`CITY_LIMIT`** (SOURCE-resolved: the depositing civic's own city limit — its base-limit config × the
  world-size scale percent; the `per.above` threshold for the over-limit unhappiness class),
  **`DISTANCE_TO_GOVERNMENT_CENTER`** (plot distance from the city to its owner's NEAREST government centre,
  0 in one — the driver of distance maintenance; served from a maintained `CityContext` store, never a
  per-read walk),
  **`TARGET_NUM_CITIES`** (the world-size's
  expected city count — `CvWorldInfo.getTargetNumCities`, e.g. 2/3/4/6/8/11/14/18 per world size; a runtime-resolved
  world constant, used as a `max:` in ranked selection §3.3), **`WORLD_WONDER`** / **`NATIONAL_WONDER`** /
  **`TEAM_WONDER`** (the count of wonders of that category in the scope — `city` = `CvCity::getNum{World,National,Team}Wonders`;
  the existing engine terms, pedia display names TBD; used as a `per` count-scaler, e.g. a trait's free-specialist-per-
  wonder), … (an engine-resolved, extensible registry).
- **`SELF`** — "this entity's own type," resolved per-entity. Used only in a `per` count-scaler ("per how many of
  me exist"). It is **not** used in `requires` — a "one of me" cap is [`allowed`](#44-allowed--caps), not a
  condition.

### 3.2 Scopes — the containment spine (always SINGULAR)

```
world › team › empire › city › plot{improvement|feature|terrain|route} › building | specialist | unit
```

A **scope** says *where* something applies or *where* a count is taken. `empire` = the player (all their
cities). A `unit`-scope effect is a **self-accumulator** (it lands on the unit itself). A `plot`-scope effect is
the plot's own intrinsic output. One off-spine scope exists: **`self`** — the entity's *own* build (e.g.
`buildRate.self` = "build *this* entity faster"), not a place in the containment hierarchy. *(Distinct from the
`SELF` count token in §3.1.)*

### 3.3 Targets — *what kind of object* receives a deposit (always PLURAL)

The differentiator between scope and target is **grammatical number.** A scope is singular (`empire`, `city`,
`plot`). A **target** is plural — `plots` · `units` · `cities` · `areas` · `empires` — and means **all objects of
that kind in the scope**, filtered by an optional predicate. So `empire` (singular) is unmistakably the *reach*
and `plots`/`units` (plural) the *receivers*, even when a root is shared. A deposit with **no** plural target
lands on the scope object itself (the city — the common case). Full deposit syntax: §6.

> **Ranked subset — `orderedBy` / `orderedByDescending` + `max:`.** A plural target may be
> narrowed to the **top-N (or bottom-N) by a metric** via an ordering qualifier plus the existing `max:` count:
> `cities.{ max: 5, orderedByDescending: CITY_SIZE }` = the **5 largest cities** (by population). `orderedBy` =
> ascending, `orderedByDescending` = descending (the standardized LINQ-style spelling); `max: N` caps the selection
> to N after ordering. This is a pure **extension** of `max:` (which both `grants` and conditions already use) — a
> bare `max:` with no ordering stays a plain count threshold, so nothing existing changes. Usable in **grants,
> conditions, and modifier targets**. **Metrics** are an extensible registry, `CITY_SIZE` (population) first. `N` is a
> literal (`max: 5`) or a world **token** when it tracks an engine constant — the *largest-cities* case is
> `max: "TARGET_NUM_CITIES"` (the world-size target city count; engine `getLargestCityHappiness` =
> `findPopulationRank() ≤ TargetNumCities`, i.e. the empire's largest *cities*, plural — **not** the single largest).
> Engine note: the cascade adds the sort/select step in **parsing**, one place for all ranking metrics.
> Implementation TODO: [plans/parked/ranked-target-selection.md](../plans/parked/ranked-target-selection.md).

### 3.4 Conditions — `all` / `any` / `noneOf`

A **recursive boolean tree**, identical wherever a condition is needed (`requires`, and a deposit's `enabled`/`disabled`). Three combinators;
each holds a list of **children**, and a child is **either a leaf** (a count/presence atom or a predicate, §3.5)
**or another combinator node** — nesting is allowed to any depth:

- **`all`** = **AND** (`&&`) — every child must hold.
- **`any`** = **OR** (`||`) — at least one child must hold. A plain OR over its **direct children** — *not*
  "OR-groups AND-ed together".
- **`noneOf`** = **NONE** — no child may hold.
- **`!` prefix** = **NOT** on a single leaf-string — `"!IS_STATE_RELIGION"` negates the
  predicate inline, so `all: ["IS_HOLY_CITY", "!IS_STATE_RELIGION"]` reads naturally ("a holy city that is NOT the
  state religion"). It is pure **shorthand for `noneOf:[X]`** on one leaf (the parser rewrites `"!X"` → `noneOf:[X]`),
  reusing the boolean tree — for negating a *group*, use `noneOf` with a nested node. (Less obvious at a glance than
  `noneOf`, but the standardized terse form; documented here.)

```jsonc
{ "all": [ leafA, { "any": [ leafB, leafC ] }, { "noneOf": [ leafD ] } ] }
//  ≡  leafA && (leafB || leafC) && !leafD
{ "all": [ "IS_HOLY_CITY", "!IS_STATE_RELIGION" ] }   // ≡ all:[ "IS_HOLY_CITY", {noneOf:["IS_STATE_RELIGION"]} ]
```

So `any` is exactly `||` on what is directly below it:

- `any: [BONUS_COPPER, BONUS_IRON]` = `copper || iron`.
- `any: [ {all:[STONE,IRON]}, {any:[COPPER,WOOD]} ]` = `(stone && iron) || (copper || wood)`.

To require BOTH "(copper or iron)" AND "(forge or foundry)", **nest two `any` nodes under an `all`** —
`all: [ {any:[COPPER,IRON]}, {any:[FORGE,FOUNDRY]} ]`. `any` never means AND — it is a plain recursive boolean
tree (`all`/`any`/`noneOf`, nestable to any depth).
Each leaf is **either** a count/presence **atom** or a **predicate** (§3.5):

```jsonc
{ "type": "BONUS_IRON", "scope": "city", "connection": "trade" }   // an atom
```

An **atom** is `{ type, scope?, min?, max?, connection? }`. **Scope is IMPLIED from the type's domain** (derived from
the ID prefix) — TECH→`team`, civic/heritage→`empire`, building/bonus/religion/corporation→`city`. One data-driven
override: a building carrying `identity.empireLevel` (§7) has EMPIRE as its domain, so an atom naming one implies
`empire` — the player-held set is the only place its presence exists
([enabler.md §2](enabler.md), [empire-level buildings](enabler.md#2-pass-1--generate-the-frontier-the-enables-family)).
State `scope` explicitly ONLY when it differs from that default (e.g. a `world`-scope victory, a `player`-scope tech).
So a **plain default-scope presence collapses to a bare type-string** — author the common case as a simple string
array: `"all": ["BUILDING_FORGE", "TECH_ASTRONOMY"]` ≡ `[{type:"BUILDING_FORGE"},{type:"TECH_ASTRONOMY",scope:"team"}]`.
Keep the object form only when a special case forces it: a `connection`, a count (`min`/`max`), or a non-default
scope. **Forcing a redundant `{type, scope}` only invites authoring bugs.** *(Plot-substrate
`{type:"TERRAIN_…"/"FEATURE_…"/"IMPROVEMENT_…"}` and `{type:"MAPCATEGORY_…"}` stay object-form — they are plot predicates, §3.5.)*

- **presence** = `min: 1` ("have ≥ 1"). Authoring presence this way keeps it future-proof if a resource later
  gains amounts.
- **count thresholds** — `min: N` (≥ N) and/or `max: N` (≤ N), both inclusive. Exact-N = `min` and `max` together.
- `connection` (resources only) ∈ `"trade"` | `"onSite"`. **The two are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE** — a gate wanting
  either states TWO atoms under an `any`, never one combined selector. `vicinity` is a separate field, not a
  `connection` value. What each means: [bonuses.md](../reference/bonuses.md).
- **`vicinity`** — a separate field, carried with or without a `connection`: which tiles of
  the city's workable radius count. A radius tile's
  ownership is one of three — and the distinction is load-bearing: **owned** (the city's team), **neutral** (unowned,
  `NO_TEAM`), or **foreign** (another team). The ownership selectors nest `owned ⊂ owned+neutral ⊂ owned+neutral+foreign`:
  - **absent** = **owned + neutral** — the **DEFAULT**: the city's own tiles plus unclaimed land,
    but NOT another team's. This mirrors the engine's vicinity (feature prereqs count neutral tiles too — `neutral`
    flag, `CvHttpServer.cpp`; terrain/improvement/peak/hill are `owned`-only via the next selector).
  - `"owned"` = **owned only** — strictly the city's own tiles (centre or owned radius tile; **no** connection or
    improvement needed), excluding even neutral. A raw owned-presence.
  - `"crossBorder"` = owned + neutral + **foreign** (any ownership) — the opt-in that ADDS foreign tiles, counting
    beyond the city's borders. **No current use-case, kept for completeness.** Name avoids the
    `all`/`any`/`noneOf` combinators (§3.4). A foreign tile's bonus is revealed per its OWN team, so it can read
    differently per asking city — exactly why foreign is gated behind this explicit opt-in rather than the default.
  - `"worked"` = a tile a citizen **works** this turn (implies owned).
  - `"onSite"` = the resource is **actually available AT this city** — however it got there. Improving a resource
    on a workable plot puts it here, and so does a building in the city that supplies it (a herd, a factory —
    `provides.bonuses`, §5a): those are the SAME act as far as this list is concerned, and the list cares only
    about what is there, never about provenance.
    > **⛔ IT IS NAMED `onSite` BECAUSE "vicinity" AND "connected" BOTH MISLEAD (owner).** The two sets are
    > ORTHOGONAL: **onSite** = the resource is here; **`connection:"trade"`** = the plot group reaches it. A
    > resource can be either without the other — a mounted unit needs horses ON SITE, a swordsman only needs
    > iron wares in the NETWORK.
    > ⚠ The retired spelling was `"connected"`, which took the trade side's word for a local question and is
    > what made the two read as one thing. `owned` (raw presence, improved or not) stays its own tier and is
    > strictly weaker than `onSite`.
    >
    > **⛔⛔ `onSite` IS AN ENABLER-SIDE CONCEPT ONLY. NO MODIFIER GATES ON IT — NOT ONE (owner).** A DEPOSIT
    > conditioned on a resource asks whether the CITY HAS IT, which is the TRADED question and is spelled as the
    > bare `{type, scope:"city", min:1}` atom. `onSite` belongs to `requires` GATES and is *"almost purely a
    > concept that creating mounted units have to deal with, very little else"* — horses must be physically here;
    > the mine building is the other explicit case. Both are enabler-side.
    > ⚠ **This has been stated repeatedly and re-derived wrongly anyway**, because the tier list above reads as a
    > menu any atom may pick from. It is not: a modifier picks the bare atom, full stop. The measured cost of
    > getting it wrong is silent and total — the curator mapped legacy `VicinityBonusYieldChanges` to
    > `vicinity:"onSite"` on the strength of its XML name (its engine read, `hasVicinityBonus`, actually means
    > *obtained* in vicinity, i.e. connected), and every one of those deposits then refused against a resource the
    > city demonstrably held: London carried 96 resources in trade and 14 on site, so Cannery's apple, crab,
    > lemons and olives were each refused while the city was trading all four.
    > ⚑ The refusal is invisible in every total — a deposit that never applies leaves no trace — which is why this
    > survives review and why the yield tooltip and `/computed/city/yield` now list the refused deposits WITH the
    > atom that refused them.

  ```jsonc
  { "type": "BONUS_SHRIMP",   "scope": "city", "connection": "vicinity", "vicinity": "owned" }      // raw presence on an owned tile
  { "type": "BONUS_GOLD_ORE", "scope": "city", "connection": "vicinity", "vicinity": "onSite" }     // must be available here
  ```

- **`PROPERTY_*` band atom** `{type:PROPERTY_X, scope, min?, max?}` — its "count" is the city's property value;
  **absent `min` = no lower bound** (a max-only band), the one exception to the presence=`min:1` convention.
  Authored in `requires.operate`.

> **Counts vs caps.** `min`/`max` express what you **need** (a count of *some other* type, e.g. "≥12 Barracks").
> "How many of THIS may exist" is **not** a condition — it is the [`allowed`](#44-allowed--caps) cap.

### 3.5 Predicates — a system's runtime-state query

A predicate asks the game state a yes/no question a static file can't hold ("is this the capital? a river?"). It
is **evaluated against the deposit's target** and so carries **no `_PLOT`/`_UNIT` suffix** — the target supplies
context: `IS_WATER` on `plots` = a water tile, on `units` = a sea unit. An **unknown/missing predicate is
IGNORED**, never treated as false — retiring a system never spuriously disables unrelated data.

> **The predicate registry is EXTENSIBLE — and a condition is ALWAYS a predicate, never a bespoke member
> ([conditions are predicates, never bespoke members](#35-predicates--a-systems-runtime-state-query)).** When a deposit's condition has no predicate named verbatim
> below yet, **define a new predicate** (add it here, wire it in the evaluator, and emit the state fact it reads).
> Adding a predicate *extends* the model within the structure. What you must NOT do is encode the condition as a new
> sub-scope **member** (`{family}.empire.capital.percent`, `perMilitaryUnit`) — that changes the core structure (the
> kraken way; see [modifier.md §3](../cascade.md), which also notes the **golden-age exception**: `empire.goldenAge`
> is a PERMANENT engine member-mirror (effect-only), because the yield effect is engine-core and not data-defined;
> golden-age length + grant ARE curated JSON (`goldenAge.empire.percent`, `grants.goldenAge`)).
>
> **`IS_*` vs `HAS_*` — literal English.** Plain English picks the prefix: `IS_*` = whether the
> target **is** something (a plot `IS_WATER`, a city `IS_CAPITAL`); `HAS_*` = whether it **has** something (a plot
> `HAS_RIVER`, `HAS_PEAK`, `HAS_COAST`). These semantics span **every target group**, not just plots — a *unit*
> `IS_MILITARY` (defined by the `military` [tag](tags.md)), a *city* `IS_CAPITAL` — so a **tag-backed predicate
> reads its tag** (that is how a [tag](tags.md) is queried inside a condition). The `HAS_*` set is the
> `<scope>.<target>` filter layer, so `HAS_COAST`
> matches **any** coastal-adjacent plot (water *or* land). The **target is the plot**:
> `HAS_PEAK` = the plot has a peak (a special case — a peak behaves as *both* a feature and a terrain, so a plot
> could *in theory* carry a terrain **and** a peak, e.g. grassland+peak; it just doesn't happen in practice). The
> `HAS_COAST`/`HAS_RIVER`/`HAS_PEAK`/`HAS_HILLS` target-filters follow the §3.5 predicate semantics; `MAPCATEGORY_`
> is an XML-only Type referenced from `requires.build` ([naming.md](naming.md)). Their space-map extensions are
> defined by the space-map work.

> **⛔ A GENERALIZED PLOT PREDICATE RESOLVES THROUGH A `foldTargets` INFO — WE NEVER FOLD ONTO A BOOLEAN
> (owner).** *"We can never fold onto a boolean predicate, we need a target to fold onto."* A deposit lands on a
> concrete substrate ENTITY (a terrain, an improvement), so a predicate that names a CATEGORY rather than an

> The evaluator resolves the predicate against that set, so the fold always has a real target.

> `IS_WATER` MEANS is readable in a file instead of being a hidden engine table. ⛔ So it is DATA, never a

> ⚠ **A relief predicate needs no carve-out** — `TERRAIN_HILL` and `TERRAIN_PEAK` are real authored terrains, so

> ⚑ **A file exists for a predicate the DATA authors, never speculatively** — the registry is open like its

- **bare** (parameter-free string), four groups:
  - **environment / domain** `IS_<where>` (target-relative): `IS_WATER` · `IS_LAND` · `IS_AIR` · `IS_SPACE` · `IS_LUNAR` · `IS_MARS`
    (extensible) — each a `foldTargets` info per the ruling above.
  - **relief form** `IS_FLATLANDS`: a plot with **no relief** — neither hills nor peak.
    It is relief-only (water is also relief-free), so **flat land** composes it with the domain: `{all:["IS_LAND","IS_FLATLANDS"]}`.
    The engine's per-plot-TYPE `PLOT_LAND` accumulator maps to exactly that pair.
  - **plot attributes** `HAS_<attr>` (relief & adjacency a plot carries, orthogonal to environment so they
    compose): `HAS_PEAK` · `HAS_HILLS` · `HAS_COAST` (adjacent to water) · `HAS_RIVER` · `HAS_FRESHWATER` ·
    `HAS_IRRIGATION` · `HAS_FEATURE` ("has *any* feature") · `HAS_LANDMARK` (the plot is an auto-detected geographic
    **landmark** — `getLandmarkType() != NO_LANDMARK`, i.e. bay/forest/jungle/peak/mountain-range/desert/lake; used by
    landmark-yield, which is also `GAMEOPTION_MAP_PERSONALIZED`-gated. NOT a natural wonder).
  - **plot city-relative state** (nested `VICINITY ⊇ WORKABLE ⊇ IS_WORKED`): `VICINITY` (in the city's workable
    radius) · `WORKABLE` (in radius and eligible to be worked) · `IS_WORKED` (a citizen works it this turn).
  - **world:** `NO_NUKES` (the world no-nukes verdict — true under the UN ban, false once nukes are enabled by anyone
    building the Manhattan Project). A nuke-enabling building (Manhattan) carries `requires.build.disabled: "NO_NUKES"`
    — it can't be built while nukes are forbidden.
  - **city / player:** `IS_CAPITAL` · `IS_GOVERNMENT_CENTER` · `HAS_POWER` · `HAS_STATE_RELIGION` · `STATE_RELIGION_IN_CITY` ·
    `IS_GOLDEN_AGE` (the player is in a golden age) ·
    **`IS_HOME_AREA`** (the city's area is the player's capital's area — the home-continent test; "other areas" is
    the plain negation `"!IS_HOME_AREA"`, never a second predicate. Retires the `homeArea`/`otherArea`
    condition-as-member authoring on `maintenance` — a maintenance modifier scoped to home/other areas authors as an
    ordinary conditioned deposit on this predicate) ·
    **`IS_REBEL`** (the city's owner is in revolt against a parent civ — the empire-state gate the rebel
    maintenance discount authors on, replacing four hardcoded halvings with one conditioned deposit) ·
    **`IS_HOLY_CITY`** (the *bare* form = the city is a holy city of **any** religion — `CvCity::isHolyCity()`; the
    parameterized `{IS_HOLY_CITY: RELIGION_X}` below keys a specific religion) · **`IS_STATE_RELIGION_HOLY_CITY`** (the
    city is the holy city **of the player's state religion** — `isHolyCity(stateReligion)`; distinct from
    `STATE_RELIGION_IN_CITY`, which is merely *present*). *(The composed "holy city of a NON-state religion" — engine
    `isHolyCity() && !isHolyCity(stateReligion)` — is `all: ["IS_HOLY_CITY", "!IS_STATE_RELIGION_HOLY_CITY"]`, the canonical use of the `!` operator §3.4.)*
    The first two are **DISTINCT**: `IS_CAPITAL` = the city is the player's capital; `IS_GOVERNMENT_CENTER` = the city
    holds a government-center building (Palace or a pseudo-palace), runtime-evaluated. Government-center buildings gate
    on `requires.build.disabled: "IS_GOVERNMENT_CENTER"` (one can't be built where a government center already exists —
    a gov-center test, not an `IS_CAPITAL` one).
  - **trade route** (evaluated against the ROUTE/its partner city): **`IS_FOREIGN`** (the route's partner belongs to
    another team — the engine's foreign-trade gate, `CvCity::totalTradeModifier`; domestic routes are the plain
    negation `"!IS_FOREIGN"`, never a second predicate) · **`SHARES_CIVIC`** (the route partner's owner runs the
    deposit's SOURCE civic — the shared-civic trade bonus; only meaningful on a deposit a civic authors).
- **parameterized** `{ PREDICATE: param }`: `{HAS_FEATURE: FEATURE_X}` · `{HAS_TERRAIN: TERRAIN_X}` ·
  `{HAS_IMPROVEMENT: IMPROVEMENT_X}` (the plot carries that improvement — the plots-filter twin of terrain/feature) ·
  `{HAS_BONUS: BONUS_X}` · `{HAS_RELIGION: RELIGION_X}` · `{STATE_RELIGION: RELIGION_X}` · `{IS_HOLY_CITY: RELIGION_X}` ·
  `{IS_HEADQUARTERS: CORPORATION_X}` (the city is that corporation's HQ — the corp analog of `{IS_HOLY_CITY: …}`;
  carries the corp-HQ revenue condition) ·
  `{HAS_CORPORATION: CORPORATION_X}` ·
  **`{CIVIC_CATEGORY: CIVICOPTION_X}`** (the CIVIC whose value is being resolved sits in that category — the gate a
  trait's *"religion civics cost no upkeep"* authors, as `upkeep.empire.civic.percent: -100` conditioned on it).
  ⛔ It carries the **FULL `CIVICOPTION_` id**, never a bare `RELIGION`, so it can never be read as a `RELIGION_`
  type. ⚑ It is a SOURCE-SLOT predicate ([contexts.md](../cascade.md) § THE SOURCE SLOTS): the walk
  resolving a civic sets the slot, and with no civic in hand it answers **FALSE** — resolving it against whichever
  civic a walk reached last would be worse than declining. ⚠ The legacy shape was a target-keyed
  `upkeep.civicOptions.{CIVICOPTION_X}` member, which is the condition-as-member rollerskate
  ([conditions are predicates, never bespoke members](#35-predicates--a-systems-runtime-state-query)) AND matched no kind
  row, so it parsed, reported `unkinded-member` and produced nothing ·
  `{latitude:{min,max}}` · `{existedFor:{min:N}}` (GAME YEARS since built -- what the player has always been told: *"doubles in 1000 years"*. The city stores the build YEAR (`getGameTurnYear`) and every authored threshold is a year count; a turn's year is derived, never stored ([engine.md](../reference/engine.md)), so nothing needs converting) ·
  `{HAS_COAST:{minArea:N}}` (the city is adjacent to a water body of **≥ N tiles**; a bare `HAS_COAST` is coastal at
  the default threshold, so an entity needing a *larger* sea body carries the size here).
- **membership sugar** `{ terrain|feature|bonus: [TYPE,…] }` = "the plot's terrain/feature/bonus is one of these";
  equivalent to an `any` of the matching `HAS_*` predicate.
- **composition is the win:** a Martian peak is `{all:["IS_MARS","HAS_PEAK"]}`; coastal land
  `{all:["IS_LAND","HAS_COAST"]}`; flat land = `{all:["IS_LAND","IS_FLATLANDS"]}` (domain + relief). No bespoke
  "mars-peak"/"coastal-land" type.
- **negation** uses the `disabled` twin (§3.9) or `noneOf` — never a `false` value.
- (a `PROPERTY_*` band atom is the one exception to presence=`min:1` — absent `min` = no lower bound; §3.4.)

### 3.6 Units — what a modifier value *is*

A magnitude names the **nature** of the value, not how the engine combines it (§6 owns the combine math):

- **`flat`** — additive amount (`+2` = `2`).
- **`percent`** — additive percent delta (`+50%` = `50`).
- **`multiplier`** — true ×factor, identity `100` (`×2` = `200`).

(Plus `postMultiplier` / `rawPercent` — rare **engine-internal** units, **not for normal authoring**; ignore them
unless porting a specific engine quirk.)

> **Values are human-readable. Always.** `7`, `25`, `1.5` — never ×100. readJson performs the one human→×100
> conversion at load ([the ×100 fixed-point model](curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries)). **A ×100 value in
> a JSON file is a bug.**

### 3.7 `per` — count-scaling

```jsonc
"per": "SPECIALIST"                                              // bare-string sugar: × count, each:1, own scope
"per": { "type": "POPULATION", "each": 5, "scope": "city" }      // value × (count / 5)
"per": { "anyOf": ["BONUS_COW","BONUS_PIG"], "scope": "city" }   // value × (summed count of any listed)
```

A bare string is the common case collapsed (the §3.4 bare-atom sugar, applied here): `"per": "SPECIALIST"` ≡
`{ "type": "SPECIALIST", "each": 1 }` at the deposit's own scope. Keep the object form only when a real `each`
quantum or a non-default scope forces it.

**`above:` — the over-threshold scaler (owner).** `"per": { "type": "CITY", "above": N }` scales by the count
EXCEEDING the threshold — `value × max(0, count − above)` — for the "per city over the limit" formula class.
The threshold is a literal or a **token** (the §3.3 threshold-token rule): `"above": "CITY_LIMIT"` reads the
depositing civic's own resolved limit. Composes with `each` (`(count − above) / each`) and the §3.9 gates.

`each` is the quantum ("per 5 population" → `each: 5`); state it explicitly. `scope` defaults to the deposit's own
scope; cross-city scopes (empire/team/world) resolve via the [tally](tally.md), `city`/`plot` are local.

**`unit: <predicate>`** qualifies a deposit by a **unit predicate** — the *same* `unit:` qualifier cargo uses
(`cargo.space.{unit: IS_AIR, …}`, [modifier](../cascade.md) §6). On a count-scaling family it reads **per unit
matching**: `happiness.empire.cities.{unit: IS_MILITARY, flat: N}` = "N happiness per *military unit* stationed" —
the unit-presence effect lives on the civic/trait that grants it, targeting each city.
The qualifier generalizes by counted kind — the field NAMES what is counted and holds the filtering predicate:
`happiness.empire.cities.{religion: "!IS_STATE_RELIGION", flat: N}` = "N happiness per city religion matching"
(here: per non-state religion present in the city).

> **Predicates vs tags.** `IS_*` predicates are **independent queries**, *not* tag-membership: `IS_LAND`
> (used by cargo above) matches an intrinsic *domain*, not a `tag`. But a predicate **may be defined to encompass
> tags** (e.g. `IS_MILITARY` set up to match the `military` tag + similar) — predicates have **definitions**.
> **Post-migration:** make predicates **definable as JSON objects** and support **predicate groups** (compose
> them); for **migration they are HARDCODED** (`IS_MILITARY`/`IS_LAND`/`IS_AIR` baked into the curator).

### 3.8 Recurrence lives on the TRIGGER plane

There is no `interval` field. Anything recurring is a `triggers` entry (§5): the cadence is the trigger
(`"onTurn"`, `{ "onTurn": N }` = every N turns), the odds are its `chance`, the payload its `action`.

### 3.9 The one entry shape

Every deposit, grant, or conditioned value is the same shape:

```jsonc
{ <payload>, "scope"?, "per"?, "enabled"?, "disabled"?, "ai"? }
```

- **payload** — a unit magnitude: a **bare number**, or `{ "value": N, … }` when conditioned or in a list — the
  **unit** (`flat`/`percent`/`multiplier`) is the key *above* the entry, and `value` carries the magnitude inside
  it. OR a grant (`type`+`count`), OR a predicate.
- **`scope`** default = the containing scope · **`per`** default ×1 · **`enabled`** default true (applies only
  while the condition holds) · **`disabled`** default false (suppressed while it holds) · **`ai`** an optional
  sibling block applied for AI players only (same inner shape).
- **Target qualifiers ride the ENTRY too** — the §3.3 ranked-subset qualifiers (`max:` / `orderedBy` /
  `orderedByDescending`) and a counted-kind filter (`religion:` / `unit:` §3.7) may sit on an individual entry;
  a qualifier written at the target-node level is shorthand applying to every entry that carries none of its
  own. This is what lets ONE plural-target node hold differently-qualified deposits side by side (a largest-
  cities entry beside an every-city per-religion entry on the same `cities` node) — the entry is the universal
  carrier.
- **`enabled` is read before `disabled`** — the enable is evaluated first, the disable second; a `disabled`
  that holds **overrides** (the deposit is suppressed even if `enabled` was satisfied). Author them in that
  order: `enabled` first in the list, then `disabled`.
- **There is no `enabled: false`** — to conditionally SUPPRESS a deposit use `disabled` (its twin); an absent
  `enabled` means always-on.
- A leaf is a single entry **or a LIST of entries** (several conditioned values into one slot). **The list IS
  the formula mechanism (owner):** a composite formula authors as the SUM of its entries — a base term, `per`
  terms, negative companions, threshold-gated bands — composed side by side; there is deliberately NO
  expression syntax. The telescoping pair is the canonical idiom: `V × (count − N)` = `{V, per: <counter>}` +
  the flat companion `{−V×N}`, both under the same gate. What entry sums cannot express is a separate
  MULTIPLICATIVE stage — that is an engine-formula parameter (a config value), never forced into entries:

```jsonc
"production": { "city": { "percent": [
    25,                                                            // always +25% (a bare number)
    { "value": 25, "enabled": { "type": "BONUS_COAL", "min": 1 } }  // +25% more while coal is connected
] } }
```

## 4. Availability

The availability sections decide **what is offered** — what unlocks what, what an entity needs, and how many may
exist. (The two-pass machine that consumes them is the [enabler](enabler.md).)

### 4.1 `enables` — what this unlocks (permanent, source-side)

```jsonc
"enables": { "units": ["UNIT_CROSSBOWMAN"], "buildings": ["BUILDING_BANK"] }
```

Buckets: `buildings · units · builds · techs · civics · religions · corporations · projects · processes ·
promotions · promotionLines · heritages · specialBuildings · specialBuildingsWaived · improvements · bonuses ·
routes · votes · hurries · traits · specialists`. **Tech unlocks live here** (a tech `enables` what it researches).

### 4.2 `obsoletes` / `replaces` / `disables` — removal (permanent, source-side)

Same per-kind bucket shape as `enables`.

- **`obsoletes`** — supersession: new builds barred; **existing instances persist** (an obsolete unit stays on the map).
  ⛔ **For a BUILDING the target-side `obsoletedBy` carries `techs` ONLY — no building ever obsoletes a building**
  ([enabler.md §2](enabler.md#2-pass-1--generate-the-frontier-the-enables-family)): a building→building relation is
  an UPGRADE CHAIN, expressed as the predecessor's reversible `requires.operate.dormant` (§4.3). The two fates
  cannot coexist on one pair — obsolescence is checked before the operate verdict, so it wins and destroys what the
  chain meant to park.
- **`whenObsolete`** — the built instance's **fate once obsolete** (its `obsoletedBy` tech is held), authored
  **target-side** as a **full modifier tree in the §6 grammar** (channels · scopes · units · `enabled`/`disabled`
  predicates — a *separate* tree, not a gate on the normal families). When the building is obsolete its **normal
  modifier families stop and this tree applies instead**; the surviving output is authored directly here and may
  differ from the working values.

  > **⚖ OBSOLESCENCE HAS THREE FATES, AND `whenObsolete` DECIDES WHICH (owner).** This is the whole rule; there
  > is no fourth case and no flag beside it:
  >
  > | `whenObsolete` | the built instance |
  > |---|---|
  > | **absent / empty** | **HARD REMOVED** — the building is gone from the city |
  > | **carries any modifier** | **STAYS**, and that tree **TAKES OVER** from its normal families |
  > | **carries the UPGRADE** | **BECOMES its successor** — the predecessor goes, the successor is placed |
  >
  > **⛔ `whenObsolete` LIVES IN ISOLATION AND DOES NOT CARE *WHAT* OBSOLETES (owner).** It declares what becomes
  > of the INSTANCE once the building is obsolete, full stop. It never names its cause, never branches on one, and
  > nothing in it may be read as "…when a tech does it". ⚑ That a **tech is the only obsoleter today** is a fact
  > about the CAUSE side (`obsoletedBy`, [enabler.md §2](enabler.md)) and is stated there — so a second obsoleter
  > kind arriving later changes that side alone and leaves every authored fate untouched. ⛔ Do not couple the two:
  > a fate that knows its trigger is a fate that has to be re-authored the first time the trigger set grows.
  >
  > **⚖ THE UPGRADE LIVES HERE — `whenObsolete` IS WHERE THE UPGRADE GOES (owner).** Becoming obsolete and what
  > becomes of the instance are ONE happening, so the fate and the successor are authored in one place. ⛔ Do
  > **not** mint a separate top-level upgrade section for it. The key is **`becomes`** (owner: *"becomes works
  > well, it's unambiguous"*), a reserved key beside the modifier families in the tree:
  >
  > ```jsonc
  > "whenObsolete": { "becomes": "BUILDING_FOUNDRY" }
  > ```
  >
  > **⛔ THERE IS NO GOLD-PAID BUILDING UPGRADE, AND THERE WILL NOT BE ONE (owner).** The upgrade is a
  > CONSEQUENCE of becoming obsolete, applied automatically — never a player action, never priced, never
  > prompted. ⚑ The unit parallel is where the temptation comes from and it stops at the structure: a unit
  > upgrade is CHOSEN and PRICED (`CvUnit::upgrade` / `upgradePrice`); a building's is neither. **Do not port
  > `upgradePrice`-shaped machinery to buildings, and do not add a cost, a prompt or a player action to this
  > fate.** ([superseded-ideas #41](../architecture/superseded-ideas.md).)
  > ⚑ **It is the OTHER half of the upgrade chain, and the two must not be confused**
  > ([enabler.md §2](enabler.md)): the successor being BUILT parks the predecessor (reversible dormancy, keyed on
  > PRESENCE); the TECH landing turns the predecessor INTO the successor (one-way, keyed on the tech). Different
  > triggers, different directions, no contradiction — a building may carry both, and the Forge does.
  >
  > ⛔ **THE PLACEMENT WALKS THE CHAIN.** Chains are real and deep — 437 upgrade edges whose target ITSELF
  > upgrades, and the bridge ladder runs 14 links — so the successor named may itself already be obsolete by the
  > time the tech lands. The walk follows the chain to the **first successor that is neither obsolete for this
  > team nor refused by its own `requires.build` in this city**, which is exactly what the legacy culture-shell
  > swap did. ⚠ If the walk finds nothing placeable the fate falls back to **HARD REMOVED** — the predecessor is
  > obsolete either way; there is simply no tier to hand it to.
  > ⚖ **THE FATE FIRES ROUTINELY; THE PLACEMENT LEG IS *VERY* RARE (owner) — and the two must not be conflated.**
  > The obsoleting tech sits typically **2–3 eras past** the successor's own availability, and *"it is very rare
  > that we have not already built the building"* — so the walk almost always finds the successor already held,
  > stops on its first test, and the fate resolves to a plain REMOVAL.
  > ⚑ **It still fires, and visibly, BECAUSE OF DORMANCY (owner).** A superseded predecessor is parked, not
  > removed, so it is still PRESENT in the city for those 2–3 eras; the obsoleting tech is what finally clears it.
  > ⇒ The routine, observable behaviour of this fate is *the long-dormant predecessor disappearing when its tech
  > lands* — not a building turning into another one.
  > ⛔ **Do not optimise the walk, cache its result, or narrow it for cost.** Its expensive leg is the cold one,
  > and its bound exists to stop a spin rather than to be tight.
  > ⚠ **The real hazard of a rare leg is the opposite of cost** — it is exercised late and seldom, so a defect in
  > it survives far longer than in a hot path. Keep it obviously correct rather than clever.
  >
  > ⚑ **Placement is IDEMPOTENT and needs no extra rule** — the ONE placement choke point already refuses a

  > ([triggers.md](triggers.md)). ⚠ **Convergence is therefore SAFE but LOSSY, and that is the intended

  >
  > ⛔ **THE OLD "NO SUCCESSOR IS PLACED" BAN NARROWS TO THE RELIC SHELL, and only there.** Its rationale was

  > twice. That reasoning does not reach a **constructible** successor, for which no tree is emitted at all — so
  > placing it delivers the effect exactly once. Relic ⇒ tree, never placed; real tier ⇒ placed.
  > ⚑ The enabler's `obsolete` set ([enabler.md §3.2](enabler.md)) is therefore the **tree-carrying** population —

  > are not in the city to hold.

  The canonical use is a wonder keeping culture/tourism while it loses its working bonus:
  `"whenObsolete": { "culture": { "city": { "flat": 5 } } }`.
- **`replaces`** — succession removal: a successor takes the predecessor's slot, removing it from the buildable set
  once the successor is itself buildable. Authored **target-side** as **`replacedBy.{kind}`** (the entities that
  hard-replace this one, e.g. `replacedBy.units`), mirroring `obsoletedBy`. The §9 `replacedBy` (whole-entity Info-swap
  under a culture-level / game-option) is the **same hard-replace mechanic** — one entity supersedes another — just a
  different trigger. *(Distinct from dormancy, where the predecessor stays inactive-but-kept: `requires.operate.dormant`, §4.3.)*
- **`disables`** — a **law/ban** that **destroys** the target (a policy forbidding a building; repeal ⇒ rebuilt
  from scratch). It is **not** the dormancy mechanism: a target that should go **dormant** while a condition holds
  (e.g. an observatory under blackened skies — it parks and auto-resumes, never nuked-from-orbit) carries
  `requires.operate.dormant` (§4.3), not a `disables`. The choice of *mechanism* IS the fate (enabler §2/§3).

### 4.3 `requires` — what this NEEDS (reversible, target-side)

The means a target needs. Two timings:

```jsonc
"requires": {
  "build":   { "all": [ {"type":"BONUS_STONE","scope":"city","connection":"trade"} ] },
  "operate": { "all": [ {"type":"CIVIC_GUILDS","scope":"empire"} ] }
}
```

- **`build`** — needed to construct it; **greyed** if missing. Checked once, at build.
- **`operate`** — needed to construct **and** keep running; if lost later the built thing goes **dormant**
  (inactive, not destroyed) and wakes when it returns.
- **`spread`** *(CORPORATIONS only)* — needed to **spread** into a city, evaluated by the spread system at
  spread time against the target city's owner — never the enabler. Same condition vocabulary; the grounded
  legacy case is the per-building empire-count need (`{type: BUILDING_X, scope: empire, min: N}`, from the
  corp `PrereqBuildings` table — authored by no shipped corp, served so future data lands live).
- **`build` and `operate` share the SAME conditional vocabulary**, including the **`dormant`** sub-clause. **Units
  carry `build` only** (a trained unit never goes dormant on resource loss; on-map behaviour is out of the cascade's
  `canTrain` scope). A unit's two upgrade relationships are **distinct gates** (the machine: [enabler](enabler.md)):
  - **`requires.build.dormant.all`** = the unit's *direct* upgrades (minus any that also `replace` it): dormant out of
    the buildable set only when **every** one resolves to a reachable-trainable unit. Fail-safe — default *not*-dormant.
  - **`replacedBy.units`** (the §4.2 `replaces` edge) = the superseders: a genuine removal, dropping the unit from
    buildable the moment any superseder is buildable.

  *(`identity.spawnOnly` (§7) is a separate never-buildable flag, not dormancy. A game-option prereq is a declarative
  `GAMEOPTION_X` condition in `requires.build`; a unit's resource/corp prereq `{HAS_CORPORATION:X}` requires the corp
  ACTIVE, vs a building's bare `CORPORATION_` = present.)*

Each is an `all`/`any`/`noneOf` tree (§3.4). A single bare predicate may be given as a `disabled`/`enabled` clause:

```jsonc
"requires": { "build": { "disabled": "IS_CAPITAL" } }   // can't be built in a city that is already a capital
```

`requires` holds genuine **needs** (resources, civics, religion, count thresholds of *other* types). It does not
hold "how many of myself" — that's `allowed`.

### 4.4 `allowed` — caps

How many of this entity may **exist**. Author the **real number** — the engine permits a build while the current
count is below it. Absent ⇒ uncapped. Two shapes, told apart by the key:

```jsonc
"allowed": { "world": 1 }     // self-cap: at most ONE of me anywhere (a world wonder; a globally-unique tech)
"allowed": { "empire": 1 }    //           at most one per player (a national wonder; a unique unit)
"allowed": { "team": 1 }      //           at most one per team (a team wonder)
"allowed": { "worldWonders": 3, "teamWonders": 2, "nationalWonders": 8 }   // category cap (on CultureLevel)
```

- **self-cap** — a **scope** key (`world`/`team`/`empire`) = "at most N of *me* at that scope." For a building the
  cap scope also makes it a world / team / national wonder.
- **category count-cap** — a **wonder-category** key (`worldWonders`/`teamWonders`/`nationalWonders`; `totalWonders`
  reserved), on `CultureLevel`, caps how many of a category a *city* may hold.

- **SpecialBuilding group cap** — each member authors `identity.specialBuildingType: SPECIALBUILDING_X`; the group
  entity holds the cap (`allowed:{empire:N}`). Member→group is authored, group→members derived.
- **Units have no `team` cap** (units belong to players) — unit caps are `world`/`empire` only; for units `world`
  reads the lifetime-created count and `empire` the live count (buildings keep all three scopes).

The engine owns ignoring caps under the relevant game options, era-scaling, and per-entity exceptions — you just
declare the number. Enforcement reads the [tally](tally.md) count.

## 5. `grants` — pure payload on the considered action · `triggers` — when/why → odds → effect

> **⚖ TRIGGER IS THE TOP-LEVEL CONCEPT — A GRANT IS A TRIGGER WITH A NULL CONDITION (owner).** The two are one
> plane in the MACHINE: `triggers` is the general form (a happening, odds, an action) and `grants` is its

```

- **lists** — `buildings · units · techs · civics · promotions · traits · bonuses · specialists`.
  ⛔ **`specialists` is a NARROW carve-out, and the test is the LIFETIME — never the payload.** Free specialists
  are ordinarily the `freeSpecialists` MODIFIER family ([modifier.md §6](../cascade.md)): alive-with-source, dying
  with the building or civic that pays for them, on the two-part amount/placement seam. Authoring THOSE as a
  grant is the retired shape ([superseded-ideas #10](../architecture/superseded-ideas.md)) and stays retired.
  A specialist is a GRANT in exactly one case: a **persisted PULSE that outlives its source** — handed over
  once, never reclaimed. ⚑ The live instance is the trait's ERA-ADVANCE specialist: it fires on the era
  advancing (`onEraChanged`, §5's trigger plane — not the trait's own considered action) and lands in the
  city's **UNATTRIBUTED** typed-free ledger, so losing the trait does not take it back. ⛔ So the question to
  ask is never "is this a specialist?" but "does removing the source remove it?" — if it does, it is the
  modifier family and belongs nowhere near `grants`.
- **numeric pulses** — `grants.<channel>: value` (`grants.revolution: -100`, `grants.goldenAge`).
- **Founder buildings are PLAIN `grants.buildings` on the settler** — the settler's considered action IS
  founding, so no bespoke section exists; an entry may carry `enabled` (`{ "building": BUILDING_X, "enabled"?:
  <condition> }`). **A settler granting buildings at settle time is a NEW mechanic coined for this rework
  (owner) — there is no legacy engine apply to port.** Do not go looking for one: the legacy `bNewCityFree` path
  (`CvPlayer::found`, gated on `isNewCityFree()`) is a DIFFERENT, now-dead mechanic that merely sits at the same
  call site. This lands with the grants machine's apply-loop
  ([grants-machine.md](triggers.md) increment 5); the data is authored and
  waiting. The settler ALONE carries the founder buildings — no civilization authors a duplicate in its own
  `grants.buildings`.
  > **⛔ EVERY founder provision rides this shape — the NUMERIC PULSES too, not just buildings (owner).** A
  > trait's start culture and its bonus starting population are **conditional grants that live on the FOUNDER**:
  > `grants.culture` / `grants.population` on the settler, with the trait as the entry's `enabled` condition.
  > Both channels are already §5 numeric-pulse vocabulary, so this needs no new key and no new machinery —
  > it is the founder shape above, applied to the payloads it was always meant to carry.

- **Recurring / chance-rolled / state-conditioned handouts are NOT grants — they are `triggers` entries**
  (trigger → chance → `action.grant`): the old `repeatable` wrapper and its `interval` field dissolve into the
  trigger; `freePromotions` is a `triggers` entry whose action promotes the units present.
  > **⚖ ITS HAPPENING IS `onUnitEnteredCity` — there is NO per-turn sweep on this plane (owner).** The applier is
  > TARGETED PROPAGATION off the unit entering, with the source going ACTIVE completing the same relation for
  > units already present — the two-leg fold shape. The rescan that shape replaced measured 42,336 assign calls
  > in ONE turn, nearly all re-checking promotions the units already held, so an end-turn pass is not to be added.
  > ⚑ `action.promote.units: "present"` states the RELATION *(active source × unit present)*; the happening states
  > when it is re-checked. Both legs together are what keep it current — neither is a cadence.
  > ⛔ **The genuine per-turn trigger `onTurn` is a DIFFERENT thing and STAYS (owner)** — a recurring roll is a real
  > happening, and the property-scaled criminal spawn above is exactly it. Do not read this as trimming the turn
  > trigger; it retires ONE fossilised token, not the cadence vocabulary.
  > ⚑ **AND THE GATE IS PER PROMOTION, NOT PER ENTRY.** `action.promote.promotions` is a list of ordinary §3.9
  > entries — a bare `"PROMOTION_X"`, or `{"promotion": "PROMOTION_X", "enabled": <condition>}` — because ONE
  > source arms different unit classes differently from a SINGLE entry (a Riding School's `mounted` promotion
  > beside an unconditional one). The gate is the legacy `<FreePromotionCondition>`, mapped onto the `IS_<TAG>`
  > predicate (§3.5), and it reads the UNIT being promoted.
  > ⛔ **A reader that takes only the bare string does not degrade to "ungated" — it drops the conditioned entry
  > WHOLE, so the promotion reaches NOBODY.** That is the silent shape to watch for on every §3.9 list: the
  > unconditional authorings keep working, so the feature looks alive while every targeted one is missing.
- **Property pulses are `triggers` entries carrying spatial intent in the action** — a per-turn `PROPERTY_*`
  change an entity emits (the engine's `PropertyManipulator`):
  `{ "trigger": "onTurn", "action": { "PROPERTY_AIR_POLLUTION": -5, "on": "plot", "relation": "near",
  "distance": 1 } }`. **Properties are first-class** (early design decision) — a property source is **never a
  parked raw block**; the action carries the `on`/`relation`/`distance` so the (#429) spatial distribution reads
  its target from here. A scaling (non-`CONSTANT`) source carries a `per` count-scaler in its `chance`/value; a
  flat (`CONSTANT`) source is the bare amount.

---

## 5a. `provides` — continuous in-vicinity supply

What an entity makes AVAILABLE in its city *while active* — distinct from `grants` (a one-shot/recurring handout).
The canonical case is a building or map bonus that supplies a `BONUS_*`: a tamed-animal herd / industrial farm
supplies its animal bonus, and a map bonus on a workable plot supplies itself. One uniform surface, so a
`connection:"onSite"` requirement is satisfied by *any* provider in the city — plot bonus **or** active building.

```jsonc
"provides": { "bonuses": ["BONUS_CAMEL", { "BONUS_MOVIE": 6 }] }
```

- **`bonuses`** — `BONUS_*` ids this supplies in-vicinity. A consumer's vicinity check unions, over the city radius,
  every provider's `provides.bonuses` (active buildings; map bonuses providing themselves). **Active only** — a
  building that is dormant/obsolete supplies nothing.
- **Supply QUANTITY** — an entry is a bare `BONUS_*` string (count **inferred 1**, the common case) **or** a single-key
  object `{ BONUS_X: N }` carrying an explicit supply count. The count is the tradeable-supply amount (`getNumBonuses`
  += N), NOT vicinity presence — vicinity is presence-only, so it reads the *keys*. The canonical count case is a
  wonder that supplies several copies of a luxury (HOLLYWOOD → 6 movies; the legacy `iNumFreeBonuses`).

---

## 6. Effects — modifier families

A modifier is how an entity **changes a game quantity** — a city's food, a unit's strength, a property's level.
The entity **deposits** a value onto a **target** — drops a contribution onto it; when several sources deposit
onto the same target, the target **sums** them and reads the combined total each turn (a Forge's +25% production and a Factory's +50% both land on
the city's production, which combines them — §6.3). A **modifier family** is one such effect, named by what it
changes (`food`, `production`, `happiness`, one per `PROPERTY_*`, …).

The full address of a deposit:

```
<family>.<scope>[.<target>|.<targetType>.{TARGET}][.<member>].<unit> = value
```

```jsonc
"happiness":  { "city": { "flat": 2 } },                                   // single-concept, scope-wide
"production": { "city": { "percent": 25 } },                               // a city-wide multiplier on output
"food":       { "city": { "improvements": { "IMPROVEMENT_FARM": { "flat": 1 } } } }, // named-entity target (keyed)
"maintenance":{ "empire": { "distance": { "percent": -10 } } }             // grouped family (member `distance`)
```

- **Split families** — one concept per key: yields are `food`/`production`/`commerce`; commerce splits into
  `gold`/`research`/`culture`/`espionage`; each property is its own family (`PROPERTY_CRIME`, …).
- **Grouped families** keep `<member>` parts (`maintenance`, `defense`, …): `maintenance` uses a `distance`
  member; `defense` uses an `amount` member, with a `min` member for the floor.
  ⚑ **`defense.amount` SUMS LIKE A FLAT and is APPLIED as a percentage (owner: "it is not a percentage in
  calculations, it's a flat sum added as a percentage for the defense calc") — which is exactly what the
  `percent` unit already means** (§3.6 / [modifier.md §2](../cascade.md): percents are ADDITIVE DELTAS that sum
  and apply ONCE, never a per-source multiplier). So it authors `percent` and accumulates on the percent side;
  the value is measured in defense points, not scaled ([the ×100 fixed-point model](curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries):
  a percent is never ×100).
  ⚑ **The stack has a FLOOR and NO CEILING — verified, because the absence is load-bearing.** The floor is the
  `min` kind (`getExtraMinDefense`), applied at the realized read.
  ⛔ **THE WHOLE FAMILY IS `percent` — EVERY member, no exceptions to remember (owner).** The values are
  *technically* flat additive sums, and they are APPLIED as a percentage — *"it does increase combat of
  defending units by the percentage anyway"* — and **defense never carries decimals**, so the ×100 that the
  `flat` unit exists to buy ([the ×100 fixed-point model](curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries): the
  scaling exists ONLY to carry two decimals) is worth exactly nothing here. ⚑ **Uniformity is the requirement,
  not the label** — *"it does not really matter at the end of the day, as long as all defense modifiers do the
  same thing."*
  ⚖ **THE DECISION TEST, and it generalizes to every family (owner): does it SUM, or does it COMPOSE?** *"We
  are summing percentages; it would have been different if they were multiplicative."* An additive delta that
  sums and applies once is `percent` (unscaled); a factor that composes by product is `multiplier` (×100,
  identity 100) — §3.6. ⛔ Decide a kind's unit by that question, NEVER by the shape the legacy XML tag
  happened to have: the tags that read like modifiers were curated `percent` and the rest `flat`, which is the
  name-eyeballing [fixed-point-and-scales.md §3](curators/fixed-point-and-scales.md) bans outright.
  ⚠ **The mixed state that ruling ends was a live ×100**, and it is the shape to recognise elsewhere: the UNIT
  plane authors every defense member `percent`, while the CITY plane had `dynamicDefense` as `flat` — and
  `dynamicDefenseTotal` SUMS the city value into the unit one. A single non-uniform member inside a family that
  adds across a seam is a silent 100×, not a tidiness question.
  ⚑ The one member outside the rule is the **`air` PLOT leg**, and it is outside because it is not a summed
  modifier at all: it is the magnitude fed to the opposed `getSorenRandNum` air-bombard dice, so nothing sums
  it and the test above does not reach it (the city `airDefense` percent is an ordinary member).
  There is **no cap of any kind** on accumulated
  defense: the contribution sites are unbounded `+=`, the total is unclamped, and the only `max`-shaped constant
  nearby — `MAX_CITY_DEFENSE_DAMAGE` — bounds DAMAGE DEALT TO defense (and is the decay denominator), a
  different axis entirely. ⚠ So an unbounded additive stack is the correct model here; do not "restore" a
  ceiling on the assumption that one was lost in the cut, and do not read the damage constant as one.
  ⛔ **There is NO separate natural-defense kind, and no max-combine.** `DEFENSE_AMOUNT` is one channel that
  BUILDINGS (153) and CULTURE LEVELS (18) both author, so the cascade holds ONE additive stack. The legacy
  `max(buildingDefense, naturalDefense)` has no counterpart here and does not survive the cut — a deliberate,
  data-led behaviour change ([validation.md](validation.md): the spec leads), not an omission to restore.
- **⛔ THE MEMBER TRIAGE TEST — a member is a KIND only if it answers *WHICH component does this modify* (owner).**
  `defense.bombardDefense` and `maintenance.distance` name components, so they are genuine kinds. A member that
  answers **WHEN or WHERE** the value applies is a **condition-as-member rollerskate** — the predicate simply has
  not been defined yet ([conditions are predicates, never bespoke members](#35-predicates--a-systems-runtime-state-query)),
  and it re-authors as a conditioned deposit (the worked case: `maintenance.empire.{homeArea,otherArea}` →
  `enabled: "IS_HOME_AREA"` / `"!IS_HOME_AREA"`, §3.5). Run this test on every proposed member: the scope axis and
  the conditions must never inflate a family's vocabulary. ⚑ A **`per<X>`-named member is its own verdict** — it IS
  a §3.7 `per` count-scaler (`perPopulation` → `per:{type:POPULATION}`), never a kind.
- **⛔ `strength` is the BASE; `combat` is everything that MODIFIES it (owner).** `strength.unit.flat` is the
  unit's base value and is absent if it cannot fight; every semantic modifier (`attack`, `defense`, `cityAttack`,
  `cityDefense`, `hillsAttack`/`hillsDefense`, `stealth`, `flanking`, `lunge`, …) plus the type-keyed vs-entries
  (`UNITCOMBAT_*`/`UNIT_*`/`TERRAIN_*`/`FEATURE_*`/`DOMAIN_*`) is `combat`, at unit/empire/team/city scope. ⛔ A
  concept with its own family never hides as a `combat` member: capture → `capture`, cargo → `cargo`, ranges →
  `air`/`range`, espionage defense → its own family.
  > **⚖ FLANKING IS KEYED BY UNITCOMBAT, NEVER BY UNIT (owner).** `combat.<scope>.flanking.{UNITCOMBAT_X}` is the
  > authored shape — *"mounted should be able to flank siege, is the very short answer."* A per-UNIT key names
  > individual units, so every unit nobody thought to list is silently un-flankable: *"right now flanking units
  > counter specific other units, which leaves grand-canyon-sized gaps in what is efficient for flanking."* The
  > class key closes them by construction, which is the whole reason it is the axis.
  > ⛔ **The per-unit table was encoding a BALANCE THEORY, and the theory is rejected (owner):** it existed so
  > that knights and horsemen could not flank cannons — *"but that is, pardon the pun, horseshit; if you manage
  > to get horses close, the artilleryman is just as fucked as any previous siege."* So there is no era gate and
  > no per-unit carve-out to preserve: getting cavalry onto a siege crew is the mechanic, and which century the
  > crew is from does not enter into it.
  > ⚑ This is the [engine.md](../reference/engine.md) UnitCombat distinction doing its job — a UNITCOMBAT is the
  > good/bad-AGAINST column, so a "vs" modifier keys on a CLASS. ⚠ It does NOT make flanking a per-target
  > enumeration: [skills.md §1](skills.md)'s note tying flanking to `targets`' narrow per-target granularity
  > describes the shape being retired, not the one to author.
- **⚖ `capture` carries BOTH WHAT YOU GET AND THE ODDS (owner).** `capture.unit.becomes` names the unit you
  receive for capturing this one; `capture.unit.probability` / `.resistance` are the odds. The two belong
  together because they are one mechanic answered from one place — splitting the result off into `identity` (or
  a bespoke block) would leave a reader holding the chance of an outcome the data never names.
  ⚑ So a family member is not required to be a magnitude: `becomes` is an FK, and that is the family stating its
  own outcome rather than a foreign concept hiding inside it.
- **THE COST CLUSTER IS THREE PLANES — do not merge them.** (1) The **actual cost** is the reserved `cost` section
  plus the entity's own self-data (`hurryCost` = "hurrying ME"; `buildTime`). (2) **What CHANGES a cost** is the ONE
  `costs` modifier family, kinds by category (`train`/`construct`/`create`/`build`/`research`/`improvementUpgrade`/
  `hurry`/`upgrade`), with **scope as the axis** — never a `world*`-prefixed kind
  ([scope is a separate axis, never folded into the kind](../architecture/patterns.md#the-coherent-surface--grouped-storage-parameterized-getters-owner-clarity-and-predictability-is-king)). (3) The **derived price** (upgrade
  gold, hurry gold/pop) is engine-computed from planes 1 × 2; its formula parameters are world/handicap config, never
  vocabulary.
- **`underworld` is the in-city criminal contest** (criminals burrow, investigators drag them out): kinds
  `insidiousness` + `investigation`, at **city AND unit scope** — the city is the arena, the unit carries the
  stat (`UNITCOMBAT_CRIMINAL` vs `UNITCOMBAT_LAW_ENFORCEMENT`, resolved by
  `CvUnit::doInsidiousnessVSInvestigationCheck`). ⚠ **`detection` belongs to the hide-and-seek plane** — the
  map-level spotting of hidden units is a different system with its own block (`hideAndSeek`, §9), and must not be folded in here.
  > **⛔ UNDERWORLD IS NOT ESPIONAGE, AND THE LINE IS THE DEFINITION OF ESPIONAGE (owner): "espionage is only
  > things that SPY UNITS can do", plus the espionage-POINT ratios that govern how much of an opponent you can
  > see.** A criminal hiding from an investigator is neither, so `insidiousness`/`investigation` are underworld
  > on BOTH planes and espionage carries only its commerce channel. ⛔ Do not re-file them by proximity: several
  > unit types carry both, which is exactly what makes the mistake easy.
  > ⚑ This was mis-filed independently in THREE curators while two others had it right — the signature of a

- The **unit plane** has its own family set (`strength`, `withdrawal`, `firstStrike`, `bombard`, `collateral`,
  `air`, `heal`, `movement`, `experience`, `workRate`, `cargo`, `vision`, `capture`, …); a `unit`-scope deposit is
  a self-accumulator.
- **`buildRate` vs `production` — keep them distinct.** `production.city` is the city's *total* output (scales
  every build); **`buildRate`** only speeds up *building a specific target*: `buildRate.self` (build **this**
  entity faster — the off-spine `self` scope), or keyed by what's built (`buildRate.<scope>.buildings.{BUILDING}`,
  or a category like `military`).
- **Era-dependent values use the `ERA` COUNTER, not a bespoke key.** Era is a plain
  counter (1…X, §3.1) like `POPULATION`/`TURN`; a value that changes with era is authored as ordinary conditioned
  deposits gated on an `ERA` count-threshold — `flat: [ {value, enabled:{type:ERA, min:N}}, … ]` — so the bands
  **accumulate for free** through normal deposit summation (every entry whose `min` ≤ the current era applies). No
  special resolver, no `world.eras` lookup. (The curator converts a legacy `EraCommerceChanges` band-table into
  era-threshold flats, mapping each era Type to its counter index.)

### 6.1 Two ways a deposit picks WHAT it lands on

- **plural object-target** (`plots`/`units`/…, predicate-filtered) = *every object of that kind in the scope*:

  ```jsonc
  "production": { "empire": { "plots": { "flat": { "value": 1, "enabled": "IS_WATER" } } } } // +1 to every empire water plot
  "food":       { "city":   { "plots": { "flat": { "value": 1, "enabled": {"all":["VICINITY","IS_WORKED"]} } } } }
  "movement":   { "empire": { "units": { "flat": { "value": 1, "enabled": "IS_WATER" } } } } // +1 move to every naval unit
  ```

- **named-entity key** (`improvements.{IMPROVEMENT_FARM}`, `terrains.{…}`, `features.{…}`, `bonus.{…}`,
  `buildings.{…}`) = a deposit onto a specific named target, kept on the source.

> **The rule:** a plot/unit **fact** (water, river, worked, hills) → a **`plots`/`units`-target predicate**; a
> **named entity** (a farm, grassland) → its **entity-key**. There is no `plotTypes`/`seaPlot` — a water plot is

### 6.2 Ownership — the deliveryguy rule

A cross-entity modifier lives on **whoever brings it to the table**, keyed by the target — never inverted onto the
target; the other entity is only ever an `enabled`/`requires` condition, never the home. Full ruling, the
own-output vs governing-deliverer split, and the plot-substrate case: [modifier.md §4](../cascade.md)
([the deliveryguy ownership rule](../cascade.md#4-ownership--the-deliveryguy-rule)).

### 6.3 How values combine

The combine arithmetic — flats sum into base, percents (additive deltas) sum and apply once, multipliers compose
by product — is the machine's, not the authoring model's: [modifier.md §2](../cascade.md). You author the values;
the engine combines them, and the combine mode is **family metadata**, never the per-value unit (§6's member-triage
test above).

## 7. Intrinsic

Empire-agnostic self-description. Read directly — never summed or cascaded.

- **`identity`** — "what am I": all **TEXT** (`description`, `help`, `civilopedia`, `message`, `quote`, `strategy`,
  `adjective`, `shortDescription`), display/pedia placement, and metadata ABOUT the entity that produces nothing on
  its own (`conquestProbability`, `mapCategories`, AI worth).
  ⛔ **`identity` is STRICTLY self-description — NEVER a catch-all** (owner): a datum that isn't "what am I"
  (e.g. per-religion spread strength) does NOT go here; it gets its own block (`spread`, §9). Reaching for `identity`
  because a value has no obvious home is the anti-pattern.
  > **⚖ `identity.pediaCategory` IS THE PEDIA-PLACEMENT MEMBER (owner)** — the concrete form of the
  > "display/pedia placement" clause above: which pedia bucket an entity is listed in. It passes identity's own
  > test outright, producing nothing on its own.
  > **⚑ AND UNIVERSALITY IS WHY IT IS ON IDENTITY AT ALL (owner): *"that is why I wanted it on identity, because
  > it lives on all of them."*** That is the discriminator to reuse, not a fact about this one field: a datum
  > every entity KIND carries belongs on the shared identity plane, while one only some kinds carry belongs to
  > their own block (a unit's `skills`, a building's `attributes`, a plot substrate's `characteristics` — §8).
  > ⇒ Pedia placement is asked of buildings, units, techs, promotions and the rest identically, so putting it on
  > any per-type block would mint the same member N times and leave each type free to drift on its meaning.
  > ⛔ **THE POINT IS THAT THE TAXONOMY BECOMES DATA — a consumer must never RE-DERIVE a category.** The pedia
  > classified buildings in Python from seven legacy per-field getters plus, for three buckets, a **substring
  > match on the localized DISPLAY NAME** (`"Folklore -"`, `"Enclosure -"`, `"Remains -"`) — a taxonomy built out
  > of prose, silently wrong in every non-English localization. Publishing those getters so the classifier
  > resolves would preserve it exactly ([build a new getter surface, never widen a legacy one](../architecture/patterns.md#-the-two-read-roles--one-grammar-two-answers-owner):
  > a walk that compiles against the new surface while doing what it always did is the half-migration).
  > ⚑ **The CURATOR derives the value once — CRAZY → curator, offline** (the [modifier.md §4](../cascade.md) trait
  > precedent), and most of it falls out of data that already exists rather than being authored: world/national
  > wonder from **which self-cap the entity authors** ([enabler.md §4](enabler.md) — the category IS the cap's
  > scope, "never from an `isWorldWonder` mirror"), the system-placed buckets from `notConstructible`/`autoBuild`
  > (§7), the off-world bucket from `mapCategories`. What genuinely needs authoring is only what no existing
  > datum expresses — the name-matched group above.
  > ⚠ **Absent means the ORDINARY bucket**, never a special case to encode; the pedia's sub-category (era
  > chronology) stays derived from the entity's own era and is not a second field.
  ⚖ **The worked case that PASSES — a unit's `domain` (owner).** Where a unit operates is empire-agnostic
  self-description that produces nothing on its own, so it is a genuine identity member rather than a value
  parked there for want of a home. ⛔ It is deliberately NOT a [tag](tags.md): a tag says what a unit IS, a
  domain says where it OPERATES, and answering the second from the tag set means filtering every tag for what
  one field holds. It is exclusive (no unit has two), and crossing a domain is a SKILL — a helicopter is a land
  unit with `canMoveAllTerrain` ([skills.md](skills.md)), never an air one.
  ⚖ **A DOMAIN IS THE MEDIUM, NOT THE PLACE (owner).** LAND is any solid surface — Earth, Mars, the Moon — so a
  planetary surface is categorised as land wherever it orbits, and infantry standing on it are LAND units.
  SPACE is the actual VOID, so only spaceships operate there (and they move over land AND space, the ordinary
  cross-domain SKILL shape above). ⛔ So "it is in space" is never a reason to give a surface unit a different
  domain, and a space domain is a question about SPACECRAFT, never about where a foot soldier is deployed.
  ⛔ **AND IT CARRIES NO EFFECTS AT ALL (owner).** Not "few", not "only intrinsic ones" — **none**. A value that
  DOES something has a home already and `identity` is never it:
  - a **held boolean ability** is a classification block — unit `skills`, building `attributes`, empire
    `capabilities` (§8). *`nukeImmune` is the worked case: a BUILDING authors it in `amenities` (it makes the CITY
    immune — the building is not the thing protected) and a plot substrate in `characteristics` (the FEATURE
    itself survives the blast). One word, two mechanics, different carriers — which is exactly why the blocks
    are distinct, and why re-homing must never merge them.*
  - a **magnitude** is a modifier family (§6) — a radius, a movement cost, a sight range, a cargo amount.
  - a **constraint on what may exist or be built** is `requires` / `allowed` (§4).
  - a **capability to trade / work / travel on something** is its own root block (`canTrade`, `canTradeOn`,
    `canWorkOn` — [capabilities.md](capabilities.md)).

  ⚠ An effect authored into `identity` is a data error.
  Two buildability flags: `notConstructible` (excluded from the player production queue; placed by another system)
  and `autoBuild` (the placing system is the band placer: placed once in every city at founding, its
  `requires.operate` toggling active/dormant forever — [enabler.md §3](enabler.md); a world/team-capped member is
  excluded and needs its own award path); `autoBuild ⊂ notConstructible`.
  ⛔ **A `notConstructible` entity carries NO `requires.build` — placement is UNCONDITIONAL and DORMANCY decides
  everything** (owner). It is placed in every city and its `requires.operate` then makes it active or dormant, the
  uniform band model ([enabler.md §3](enabler.md)) applied to the whole queue-excluded class. `build` only ever
  greys a QUEUE candidate and is checked once; a queue-excluded entity is never a queue candidate, so a clause left
  in `build` would never be evaluated again. Authoring one is a data error — the curator folds it into `operate`.
  A third holding-scope flag: **`empireLevel`** — the building is held by the PLAYER, once, empire-wide, and is
  never present in any city; an atom naming one implies EMPIRE scope (§3.4 — the tag IS the type's domain).
  Curator-DERIVED from empire-uniformity, never hand-authored; the machine and the membership rule are
  [enabler.md §2](enabler.md) ([empire-level buildings](enabler.md#2-pass-1--generate-the-frontier-the-enables-family)).
  **Civilization selectability** lives here too: `playable` / `aiPlayable` (can a human / the AI pick this civ) —
  **load-only metadata, no gameplay relevance** (animals/barbarians/neanderthals are technically civilizations), so
  it is intrinsic self-description, not a `policy`.
- **`cost`** — what it costs to make (`production`, and cost sub-fields).
- **`ui`** — interface art/sound (icons, buttons, movies) · **`world`** — **on-map 3D art**: the `world.art` block
  carries the on-map art **tag ids** — the `ART_DEF_*` **art-define tag** plus the model / texture references it
  spans (art is more than the icon — models and textures too). **Only the tag ids live in JSON**; the art
  *definitions* stay in the ART XML (`CIV4ArtDefines_*`), resolved by `ARTFILEMGR` from the id (a `BUILDING_`/`UNIT_`
  entity keeps `getArtInfo()` = `ARTFILEMGR.get<X>ArtInfo(<the id>)`). `ART_`/`EFFECT_` ids are XML-only Types
  ([naming.md](naming.md)), *referenced* from here. · **`sound`** — audio assets.

## 8. Classification — unit `skills`/`tags`/`state`, building `attributes` & empire `capabilities`

A unit's classification splits into **three blocks, distinguished by lifecycle**. The **operative test: *can a
promotion grant it?***

- **`skills`** — **mutable** unit abilities, gained/lost via promotions (`blitz`, amphibious, walk-on-mountains,
  fly-over-water, …). *Promotion-grantable ⇒ skill.* **A skill is a PURE BOOLEAN ENABLER — the unit mirror of empire
  [`capabilities`](capabilities.md)** ("can walk over river", "can fly over water", "can pass peaks"): it carries
  **no value**, so a **UNIT authors `skills` as an ARRAY OF STRINGS** (`["pillage","blitz"]`), never `{name:true}` —
  a skill cannot be `false` (absent ⇒ not held). Anything that carries a value is **not a skill**: keyed
  targeting/immunity (`targets`/`unitTargets`/`defenders`) → the combat (`strength`) family; a per-type variant that
  collapses to one enabler stays a skill (`collateralImmune` = immune to the siege-variant collateral). Only where
  **revoke** is real — a **PROMOTION** granting *or removing* a skill — is the object form (`{name:true|false}`) used
  (the grant/revoke plane, skills.md §4). Glossary: [skills.md](skills.md).
- **`tags`** — **immutable, type-derived** membership: set at creation, re-set on **upgrade**, **purely for
  accounting** — overlapping (`military`/`civilian`/`worker`/`spy`/`landUnit`/`gunpowder`/`mechanized`/…), counted by
  the engine/tally, **no behaviour or modifiers**. Like skills, a tag is pure membership with **no value**, so a unit
  authors `tags` as an **ARRAY OF STRINGS that is ALWAYS PRESENT** (empty `[]` until the unitcombat→tags distillation
  fills it — never optional/absent; there is no real unit with zero tags, but the schema keeps the array mandatory).
  A tag is **queried via its `IS_<TAG>` predicate** — a unit `IS_MILITARY` ⟺ it has the `military` tag (§3.5), a unit
  `IS_LAND` ⟺ `landUnit` (the domain `DOMAIN_*` is a tag: `landUnit`/`seaUnit`/`airUnit`; the enum stays engine-side
  for movement/stacking) — while the *generic* `IS_*` predicates (`IS_WATER`) read game state, not a tag. *Not*
  promotion-grantable (a swordsman must upgrade to a rifleman to gain `gunpowder`).
- **`state`** — **transient** conditions (fired → counted down → over: `paralyze`/immobilise). **Greenfield** —
  never first-class; historically faked via pseudo-promotions + Python events.

The **empire** counterpart to unit `skills` is **`capabilities`** — **team-wide, unlocked** civilization
abilities (found-on-peaks, pass-peaks, move-on-water, tech-trading, irrigation, bridge-building, river-trade,
and the commerce sliders `setScienceRate`/`setCultureRate`/`setEspionageRate`). **Capabilities are empire-HELD but
grantor-PROVIDED** — a **tech**, a **civic**, or a **building** *provides* one, and the empire then *holds* it. A
grantor **provides**, never **holds**; a capability appears in a grantor's `capabilities` block to mean "I hand this
to the empire." (This is exactly parallel to a tech granting an ability — the same block, three grantor kinds.) The
**section name carries the scope**, so the engine never guesses. **Behaviourally nothing is *granted*:** the
empire's active set is **derived on query** — an enabler-style union over the currently-live sources (the enabler's
HAVE axis); "provides" is the data direction, not an apply event, so a capability lapses with its last live source —
headroom only: in practice no capability is ever disabled today. See [capabilities.md](capabilities.md).

A **building** additionally has its own **`attributes`** block — what the building **IS or DOES ITSELF**, held and
immutable: `teamShare`, `destroyedOnCapture`, `orbital`, `orbitalInfrastructure`. Plain booleans, like
`skills`/`capabilities`, and again the section name carries the scope (building). The **hold-vs-provide
distinction is load-bearing**, and it runs in three directions: `attributes` are the building's own property,
`capabilities` are what it *hands to the empire*, and `amenities` (below) are what it *hands to its own city*. So
`destroyedOnCapture` is an `attribute` (a fact about the building), `setCultureRate` is a `capability` (handed to
the empire), and `nukeImmune` is an `amenity` (it makes the CITY immune — the building is not the thing protected).

> **⚖ A UNIT CARRIES `status`, AND A STATUS IS A PER-TURN COUNTER (owner).** It is **a specific counter that gets
> DECREMENTED EVERY TURN** — applied to the unit, ticking down, and over when it reaches zero. That is the whole
> of what separates it from the unit's other blocks.
> ⚑ **So it is an id→COUNT like a city's `amenities`, but the COUNT MEANS SOMETHING ELSE, and the difference is
> the model:** an amenity's count is a REFCOUNT of live grantors (it moves when a grantor is added or repealed,
> which is what events do to it), while a status's count is **TURNS REMAINING** and moves on its own, every
> turn, with no grantor involved after the moment it was applied. ⛔ Do not fold the two onto one mechanism on
> the strength of both being id→COUNT: one expires, the other is held.
> ⚑ **The READ is therefore the ordinary `ContextDict` one (owner): the status HOLDS while its value is above
> zero** — `hasStatus(id)` ≡ `count > 0` ([contexts.md](../cascade.md)), so nothing needs a
> separate present/absent plane beside the counter. Expiry is the counter reaching 0, not a second fact.
> ⛔ A status is emphatically **NOT a [skill](skills.md)**: a skill is an ability the unit HAS, a status is a

A **CITY** has its own **`amenities`** block — the **city-HELD, grantor-PROVIDED** counterpart, standing to the
city exactly as `capabilities` stands to the empire. The hold-vs-provide axis otherwise stops one scope short:
`attributes` is what the building *is/does itself*, `capabilities` is what it *hands to the empire*, and
`amenities` is what it *hands to its own CITY* — which is what most authored keys actually do. The two split
by asking whose property it is:

- **`attributes` — about the BUILDING** — `teamShare` · `destroyedOnCapture` · `orbital` · `orbitalInfrastructure`.
- **`amenities` — conferred on the CITY** — `nukeImmune` · `governmentCenter` · `providesFreshWater` ·
  `providesPower` · `abolishedAnger` · `abolishedUnhealthFromPopulation` · `abolishedUnhealthFromBuildings` ·
  `adds3rdRing` · `borderObstacle` · `forceAllTradeRoutes` · `capital` · `protectedCulture` · `zoneOfControl`.

> **⚖ THE WELLBEING OFF-SWITCHES ARE ONE NAMED FAMILY — `abolished<Channel>` optionally `From<Source>` (owner:

⚑ **The grantor is not only a building, and the SCOPE says how far it reaches (owner: "a city or cities").** A
building's `amenities` land on its OWN city; a civic / trait / tech authoring the same block reaches EVERY city
of the empire — the ordinary scope spine (§3.2), on the same derived-union-over-live-sources mechanic
`capabilities` uses, so no new machinery and no per-grantor special case.

> **⛔ STORED AS AN ID→COUNT DICTIONARY, NEVER A BITSET (owner) — absent or 0 is false, anything else true.**
> *Several* sources can confer the same amenity, so the city holds a COUNT per amenity id and a removal

The **PLOT SUBSTRATE** has its own **`characteristics`** block — the **HELD**, immutable, **plot-scope** intrinsics
of whatever IS the plot: **terrain · feature · improvement · route**, all four carriers, one block and one registry
(the §3.2 spine's `plot{improvement|feature|terrain|route}`). Plain booleans like its siblings, the section name
carrying the scope. `countsAsPeak`, `actsAsCity`, `bombardable`, `zoneOfControl`, `ignoreTerrainCulture`,

⛔ **The bound — does it describe THE THING, or WHERE THE THING MAY GO?**

- **A CHARACTERISTIC describes the substrate itself**, intrinsically and always, including what may be done *to*
  or *on* it: `unfoundable` (no city may be founded here), `unimprovable` (no improvement may be built here),
  `prohibitsBonus`, `bombardable`, `nukeImmune`, `actsAsCity`, `countsAsPeak`. These are read BY other systems —
  the founding gate, the worker-build gate, bonus placement — but they are properties of the feature, not
  conditions the feature is tested against.
- **A PLACEMENT CONDITION says where this substrate may EXIST**, and is evaluated against the plot's live state:
  `requiresFlatlands`, `validTerrains`, `noCoast` / `coastalOnly`, `noRiver` / `requiresRiver`, `noAdjacent`.
  Those author in `requires` (§4) like any other condition.

⚑ **The grammatical tell tracks the real one:** a characteristic is an adjective about the thing (`bombardable`,
`unfoundable`) — a placement condition names the ground it needs. ⚠ Do not read "it restricts something else" as
disqualifying: `unfoundable` restricts city founding and is still a characteristic, exactly as `bombardable`
restricts nothing and is one. The question is whose property it is, never who is affected by it.

**Two further unit blocks:**

- **`builds`** — the unit's per-type **`BUILD_*` repertoire** (which worker-builds it can perform), owned **per unit-type**
  (tech gates *which builds are unlocked* — via `enables.builds` / the BUILD's own prereq; `builds` is *which THIS unit
  can do*; NOT "all workers, tech-gated"), promotion-augmentable. Wired as an **intrinsic key** (the readJson base skips
  it; `CvUnitInfo` parses it). Same shared-vocabulary word as `enables.builds` — a `BUILD_*` list either way; the
  enclosing section gives the relationship (`enables.builds` = "unlocks these," unit `builds` = "can perform these").
- **`missions`** *(PERMANENT carve-out — missions/CvOutcome ground-up rework)* — the actions a unit **performs**, each
  producing an **outcome**; **a mission carries its `grants`** — the outcome (what lands) IS the mission's grant payload.
  Unifies the hardcoded mission-abilities (MISSION_CONSTRUCT/DISCOVER/GOLDEN_AGE — carried today by `grants.buildings` /
  `greatPersonAction` / `goldenAge`) with the **`CvOutcome`** system (`CvUnitInfo` `KillOutcomes` + `m_aOutcomeMissions`
  — data-driven MISSION→outcome-list with cost/conditions/kill). The CvOutcome DATA is ALREADY JSON-migrated into the
  `outcomes` block below; what this future `missions` block adds is the CONCEPT unification with the
  hardcoded abilities.
  The distinction from `skills`: a **skill** is a standing/permanent property; a **mission** is an action (often
  consuming the unit). `grants` is therefore BOTH an entity-level handout AND a mission's outcome payload.
  > **⚖ OUTCOME PAYLOAD VOCABULARY (owner) — the `outcomes` block uses clean VERB-PER-PAYLOAD keys.**
  > `outcomes.kill[]` (combat-kill) / `outcomes.actions[]` (missions), each entry
  > `{ requires:{outcome:OUTCOME_*, plot?, unit?}, chance, <reward verbs> }`. Each effect is a verb, collision-checked

  > **`spawns`** `{unit,toCity?}` · **`places`** a bonus · **`promotes`** · **`triggers`** an event ·
  > **`consumes`** the unit · reused families for one-shot yields (`food`/`production`/`commerce`/`gold`/…),
  > `greatPeople`/`population`/`revolution`, `happiness:{duration}`, `PROPERTY_*`; `{python}` for Python-authoritative

  > round-trip). `Adapt*` gamespeed scaling is pure-engine, applied at grant time — never in the data. See
  > [mission-outcome-system.md](../reference/mission-outcome-system.md).

A **building's** `grants.traits` (a whole trait conferred on the **OWNER** empire *while the building is active*, reverting
on loss — `owner.setHasTrait`, civ-traits only, `CvCity.cpp:4614`) is the same grantor-**provides** / empire-**holds**
pattern as `capabilities` — but the held thing is a full **trait** (effect-bundle), not a boolean ability. So it re-homes to
**`enables.traits`** (the building contributes trait T to the empire's active-trait HAVE, which the modifier already reads),
NOT `grants` (it is held-while-active, not a one-shot handout).

## 9. Auxiliary & bespoke sections

Data read by a specific system, not the cascade. Use only when the entity needs it:

- **`policies`** — **pure empire STATES** an entity enacts: named declarative on/off conditions of the whole
  civilization (`noForeignTrade`, `noCorporations`, `allReligionsBanned`, `fixedBorders`, `noNonStateReligionSpread`,
  …). Granted by a **civic** (adopted — active while the civic is in force) or a **trait** (permanent while the trait
  is held) — one meaning, two grantors, exactly parallel to a tech granting a [capability](capabilities.md). **A policy
  is a PURE STATE, never a parameterized/targeted rule:** `allReligionsBanned` ✓;
  `onlyAllowedToBuildReligion: X` ✗ — a *targeted* restriction that carries a WHAT is an [enabler](enabler.md) concern
  (`enables`/`disables`/`requires`), not a policy. This is the group-unambiguity discipline (each group name = exactly
  one meaning; cf. empire `capabilities` vs unit `skills` vs `tags`). *(NOT here: civilization selectability
  `playable`/`aiPlayable` → `identity` §7, load-only. The legacy NPC `stronglyRestricted` build-lockdown and its
  `EnabledCivilization` whitelists are a KILLED mechanic — owner: a civ whitelist is poorly visible game design;
  techs decide what a civ can build, and `disables` covers any bar ([superseded-ideas #38](../architecture/superseded-ideas.md)).
  Some legacy trait keys under `policies` are EFFECTS, not states: `freeSpecialistPer{World,National,Team}Wonder`
  (free specialists scaled by wonder count, CvCity:5764) belong to the `freeSpecialists` modifier family, keyed by
  the `WORLD_WONDER`/`NATIONAL_WONDER`/`TEAM_WONDER` count token (§3.1).
  (NB `nonStateReligionCommerce` was *suspected* an effect but is VERIFIED a pure STATE — a Free-Church permission that
  non-state religions' `stateReligionCommerce` applies — so it correctly STAYS a policy.)*
> **⛔ THERE IS NO `succession` SECTION — it was an INVENTION, and it is the `cityFounding` failure repeated
> (owner).** A minted block reached this spec's bespoke list, the curator, `CvTraitInfo`'s members and the
> authored data, so every layer ratified it and each reader in turn found it sanctioned.
> ⚖ **A LADDER IS AN `enables` EDGE.** "What does holding this unlock?" is the GENERATE pass's own question
> ([enabler.md §2](enabler.md)): a rung `enables` the rung above it, and the gate that a rung needs the one
> beneath is its `requires` — the shape §9 already specs for a promotion line. Ordering needs no section of
> its own, and a manual upgrade link is likewise an edge, never a bespoke key.
> ⛔ The tell that it was never real: NOTHING authored `enables.traits`, because the edge that belongs there
> was being parked in a section instead — so the enabler could not see a relationship it owns.
- **`promotionLine`** (PROMOTION) — `{ PROMOTIONLINE_X: rank }`, the promotion's rung on a named ladder.
  **⚖ A LINE IS A LADDER, AND HOLDING A RUNG IMPLIES THE RUNGS BENEATH IT** — each level's `requires.build`
  names the level below (`ACCURACY3` → `ACCURACY2` → `ACCURACY`), so a unit carrying the top of a line carries
  the whole chain. ⇒ **What that unit HAS from the promotion is the SUM down the line**, not the rung's own
  value.
  ⚑ **That is why there are TWO reads, answering different questions** — the promotion's own getters say what
  THIS RUNG contributes (what the pedia says *about* a promotion), and the line accrual says what a unit
  HOLDING it actually has (what the unit's tooltip shows). Neither approximates the other; a consumer picking
  the wrong one displays a number the unit does not have. The accrual's membership is derived ONCE at load and
  summed in exactly one place ([the DRY single-implementation law](../architecture/patterns.md#dry--one-implementation-per-calculation--evaluation-the-single-source-law)),
  never rebuilt per read.
  ⛔ **A STATUS promotion accrues only ITSELF** — status / affliction / equipment lines are parallel states
  rather than a ladder, so summing them would invent a compounding that does not exist.
- **`excludes`** — same-tier mutual exclusion (conflicting traits).
- **`produces`** — a Build's outcome FKs (what laying it creates).
- **`replacedBy`** — a conditional whole-entity swap (an alternate Info under a culture level / game option; e.g.
  `CULTURELEVEL_ALT_POOR`). *(NOT the building `ReplacementBuildings`, which is reversible dormancy → `requires.operate.dormant`, §4.2/§4.3.)*
- **`condition`** (Victory) · **`effect`** (Vote) · **`outcomes`** (mission results) · **`mapGeneration`**
  (placement/spawn config). *(**`vision`** is NOT here — it is an ordinary modifier family with its own machine,
  [vision.md](vision.md): a sight budget spent walking outward, exactly as movement works.)*
- **`shrine`** — the building is a religion's SHRINE: `shrine: RELIGION_X` (the religion FK). A top-level
  section, not an `identity` marker — the shrine relationship IS the data.
  ⚖ **THE COMMERCE LANDS ON THE SHRINE BUILDING, IN THE CITY THE SHRINE STANDS IN (owner)** — an ordinary
  `<commerce>.city.flat` entry on the BUILDING, `per`-scaled by the count of cities holding the religion
  (`{type: RELIGION_X, scope: "world"}`, which resolves through the same count legacy scaled by). It needs no
  condition: a building deposits only where it stands and only while active, so its presence IS the gate — the
  [the deliveryguy ownership rule](../cascade.md#4-ownership--the-deliveryguy-rule) rule read straight, since the shrine building
  is what brings the commerce to the table.
  ⛔ **The values do NOT live on the religion**, and a `shrine` block holding per-commerce magnitudes is not a
  home for them — that is a bespoke section carrying a MAGNITUDE, outside the one machine
  ([every modifiable number is a yield](../cascade.md#1-one-step-deposit-down-accumulate-read-o1)).
  ⚠ **Do NOT gate it on `IS_HOLY_CITY` instead.** The tempting symmetry with the corp HQ fails here: a
  headquarters building is PLACED by `setHeadquarters`, while a shrine must be BUILT — so a holy city that has
  not built its shrine would start collecting.
  ⚑ **Its AI valuation reads the `expected*` what-if, never the compiled sum (owner)** — the scaler is what
  makes a shrine worth building, so an unscaled read prices it at a single point of commerce and the AI
  "downprioritizes building a shrine over taking tech."
- **`headquarters`** — the corp-HQ analog of `shrine`: the building is a corporation's HEADQUARTERS,
  `headquarters: CORPORATION_X` (the corporation FK). Same FK shape as `shrine`, one for religion and one for
  corporation.
  ⚖ **But the VALUES live elsewhere than the shrine's, and the difference is the mechanic, not an inconsistency.**
  The HQ's per-commerce revenue stays on the **corporation** as `<commerce>.city.flat` gated
  `{IS_HEADQUARTERS: CORPORATION_X}`, because the HQ is a DESIGNATION the engine places and announces
  (`SEVT_CITY_HEADQUARTERS_ADDED / _REMOVED`), so the predicate has a crossing to ride. A shrine has no such
  designation — only a building somebody BUILT — so its values live on that building, whose presence is the gate.
  ⇒ Both land in the one city that holds the thing; what differs is whether a maintainable predicate exists to
  express it. ⛔ Do not "unify" them by moving either: each is on the only carrier its own mechanic supports.
  ⚑ Two more corp-HQ shapes ride this FK and are not authored anywhere today: the HQ's FREE UNIT is an ordinary
  `grants` payload keyed off the headquarters fact ([triggers.md](triggers.md)), never an info getter; corp-vs-corp
  EXCLUSION is a same-tier `excludes` entry (above), not the consumed-bonus overlap competition currently answers
  from alone.
- **`spread`** (UNIT) — the unit's per-religion / per-corporation **spread strength** (a standing capability, NOT a
  timed handout): `spread.religion: { RELIGION_X: N }` / `spread.corporation: { CORPORATION_X: N }` — keyed magnitude
  maps (`N` = the legacy `iReligionSpread`/`iCorporationSpread`). Its **own** block on purpose (owner):
  burying spread strength under `grants` (one-shot/recurring handouts) misleads a modder — it is what the unit is
  *able* to spread and *how strongly*, read by the missionary / corporate-executive spread systems.
- **`sizeMatters`** — the data the **Size-Matters** combat system needs (gated by `GAMEOPTION_COMBAT_SIZE_MATTERS`),
  a dedicated block per the own-block rule below. It is **cross-entity** — "size matters is mostly governed in
  unitcombat" — so the **base ranks are authored on UnitCombat** (the source) and summed onto the unit at load, while
  **Promotion** carries the runtime deltas:
  The block's keys are the same across entity kinds; the **base-vs-delta semantic is carried by the entity**, not a
  key suffix. Members: base ranks `qualityBase`/`groupBase`/`sizeBase` (UnitCombat only); the scalars `quality`,
  `group`, `sizeModifier`, `maxHP`; `combatModifier: { perSizeMore, perSizeLess, perVolumeMore, perVolumeLess }`;
  `cargo: { smSpace, volume, volumeModifier }`.
  - **UnitCombat** (the intrinsic **base ranks** + SM combat data): carries `qualityBase`/`groupBase`/`sizeBase` plus
    `maxHP`/`combatModifier`/`cargo`. A base equal to the legacy `−10` "unset" sentinel is emitted **absent** (never
    `0` — `0` is a real rank).
  - **Unit** (its own SM fields): `combatModifier` (its per-rank combat mods), plus `groupSize`/`baseCargoVolume`
    where authored. ⚖ **`smSpace` is DERIVED, not authored (owner): under Size Matters a carrier's space follows
    from how many units it can carry** — so it derives from the `cargo` family's capacity, the same
    derived-at-load class as the ranks below. The data agrees: **no unit authors it** (legacy `iSMCargo` appears
    in no unit record); the only authorings are the 23 PROMOTION deltas, which are the delta plane working as
    intended. ⛔ So carrying capacity has ONE home — **`cargo`** ([modifier.md §6](../cascade.md)) — and the SM
    figure is read off it, never a second authored number to keep in step.
    The unit's quality/group/size **RANK is DERIVED at load, never stored**: `Σ` over the unit's
    combat classes (primary `combatClass` + the `combatClasses` subs) of each `*Base` where `> −10` — reproducing the
    engine post-load pass (`CvUnitInfo`: `m_iBaseGroupRank += getGroupBase()`). The group rank feeds `getUnitCountSM`
    (`count ⁄ 3^(groupRank−1)`), so a stubbed `0` divides by zero — the getter MUST return the real derived value.
  - **Promotion** (the SM **deltas** a promotion applies): `quality`/`group`/`sizeModifier`/`maxHP` +
    `combatModifier`/`cargo` — same keys, applied as changes when the promotion is gained.

  Effective runtime rank = the derived info base + `Σ` held-promotion changes + the engine merge/split accumulators
  (`getExtraQuality`/`Group`/`Size` — live engine state, **never** data). Block absent ⇒ the entity carries no SM
  data. *(This is the pattern for every game-option-specific system — each gets its own block; `hideAndSeek`
  below is its sibling.)*
- **`hideAndSeek`** — the concealment-vs-detection CONTEST (gated by `GAMEOPTION_COMBAT_HIDE_AND_SEEK`), the
  own-block sibling of `sizeMatters`. **Two contest members, one per side of the equation:** `concealment` (how
  well this unit hides) and `detection` (how well it finds a hidden one, per method it answers, each entry
  qualified `{unit: HAS_<SKILL>}`). Both are graduated magnitudes and both may be NEGATIVE — a negative
  detection deposit is counter-detection, a negative concealment strips cover (the `WANTED` line does exactly
  that).
  ⛔ **The block's third member, `method`, belongs to the CLASSIC system, not the contest** — the ONE method a
  unit hides by when the option is OFF, carried from the legacy single `<Invisible>` tag (`"method":
  "camouflage"`). Legacy authored TWO invisibility planes — the single classic tag, and the per-type intensity
  tables the contest replaced — and only units carrying the single tag were ever classically invisible. The
  classic engine branch reads `method` ALONE; deriving it from the method-skill union instead made every
  contest-only hider (the robber class authors no classic tag) classically invisible for the first time ever,
  and border patrols stopped killing criminals. ABSENT means classically never-invisible; the skill set still
  carries the contest's membership beside it.
  ⚑ **The METHOD is not in this block at all — it is a [skill](skills.md)** (`camouflage`, `cloaked`,
  `disguised`, …), because a promotion can grant one and optical camouflage is precisely that
  ([vision.md §4](vision.md)). A [tag](tags.md) could not hold it: tags are not promotion-grantable, and 73
  promotions author a method.
  ⛔ **It is NOT part of `vision`, and the separation is load-bearing (owner).** `vision` answers *how far do you
  see*; this answers *do I perceive what is standing there*. The legacy engine's two evaluations bled into each
  other for years, so expressing them as one family is what lets that bleed re-form. The contest READS the
  [vision](vision.md) budget for reach and never the reverse.

**Combinators** — `all` (AND `&&`) · `any` (OR `||`) · `noneOf` (NONE), each over its direct children (leaf or nested node); a recursive boolean tree, nestable to any depth
**Atom** — `{ type, scope, min?, max?, connection? }` · presence = `min:1`
**Predicate** — bare (`IS_*`/`HAS_*`/`VICINITY`/`IS_CAPITAL`…), `{PREDICATE: param}`, or membership `{terrain|feature|bonus:[…]}`
**Units** — `flat` (amount) · `percent` (+% delta) · `multiplier` (×, identity 100). Human-readable; ×100 is a bug.
**Entry** — `{ <payload>, scope?, per?, enabled?, disabled?, ai? }`
**`requires`** — `build` (greys) / `operate` (greys + dormancy)
**`allowed`** — `{scope:N}` self-cap, or `{worldWonders|teamWonders|nationalWonders:N}` per-city category cap
