# JSON data spec — the authoritative entity shape & vocabulary

The single source of truth for what a Stones2Stars data file may **contain**. Every game entity — a building,
unit, tech, civic, religion, terrain, … — is **one JSON object in its own file** under `Assets/Data/<type>/`.
The three **cascade** machines — the engine systems that read this data: [enabler](enabler.md) ("can I build
it?"), [modifier](../cascade.md) ("how much?"), [tally](tally.md) ("how many?") — plus `readJson` consume exactly
this shape; the future modder reference is *derived* from this spec, never the other way round.

**The one promise — the data reads cold.** A well-authored file is understandable with zero engine knowledge.
Keys say what they mean; values say what they are. If a shape only makes sense once you know the C++, it is
wrong — the engine is built to fit the data.

> **Validate while you author.** `readjson.exe Assets/Data --render BUILDING_FORGE` parses a file, flags anything
> unrecognized, and renders it to plain English (*"Forge: +25% production; +1 happiness while powered; unlocks
> Crossbowman"*) so you can check "is this what I meant?".
