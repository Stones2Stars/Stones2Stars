## 1. The model — integer ×100 for AMOUNTS, human only at the IN and OUT boundaries

×100 fixed-point is the engine's **native representation for every AMOUNT** — a yield, a combat value, any
magnitude — carried that way through the cascade, the realized getters and the consumers. No floats anywhere —
this is OOS-load-bearing (Civ4 MP is deterministic lockstep; CPU-dependent float math desyncs).
`V100 = round(human × 100)`, so `1.00 → 100`, `7 → 700`, `0.5 → 50`; `FIXED_ONE = 100`.

> **⛔ THE ×100 EXISTS FOR ONE REASON — TWO DECIMALS ON AN AMOUNT (owner).** *"The reason for multiplying int
> values by 100 is so we can have 2 decimals… so we can express anything with 2 decimals at edge."* That is the
> whole of it, and it is what decides where the scale applies.
>
> **⛔ A PERCENTAGE IS THEREFORE NOT SCALED (owner): *"percentages should not have decimals."*** A percent is a
> whole number, so it has no decimals to carry and the ×100 buys nothing. Scaling it costs a **second identity
> constant**: `100 + Σpercent` becomes `10000 + Σpercent` at every site a percent is combined, and that magic
> `10000` then has to be threaded through every consumer — which is exactly the fudge-factor class §4c-bis exists
> to reject. `flat` and `multiplier` DO convert (a flat is an amount; a multiplier is authored on the same
> two-decimal footing, identity 100 → `×1.5` = `150`).
>
> ⚑ **This is NOT a per-channel carve-out** ([the ×100 fixed-point model](#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries)'s
> uniformity still binds): the rule is per **UNIT** and applies identically to every family. No channel gets a
> special case; `percent` simply is not a two-decimal quantity in any of them.

Human numbers exist at exactly **two boundaries** — nobody in between guesses scales, and **no getter has a ×100
"variant"** (there is no `getX()` + `getX100()` pair; the getter simply IS ×100):

| Layer | Job | Sees ×100? |
|---|---|---|
| **XML** (legacy, frozen) | the inherited data — MIXED scales (some fields `*Changes100`, some normal) | the mess we're leaving |
| **CURATOR** (`Tools/Migration/`) | resolve the XML per-100-vs-normal ambiguity → emit **uniform human-readable** numbers to JSON | reads ×100 XML, writes human |
| **JSON** (`Assets/Data/**`) | human numbers only (`7`, `25`, `1.5`) — **no ×100, no scale markers** | NO |
| **readJson** (the IN boundary) | the **entire** human→×100 conversion, once at load, keyed on the authored UNIT (amounts convert; percents do not) | converts amounts → ×100 |
| **CASCADE + getters + consumers** (the engine) | pure integer ×100 math; the realized getters return ×100 and every consumer carries it | ×100 throughout |
| **READERS** (the OUT boundary) | ×100 → human, once: any READER (UI / the `/computed` HTTP fields / the `Cy*` Python wrappers) does its own trivial `÷100`. A value that is physically a **whole game count** (angry citizens, a food modifier) reduces at the **point of use** that consumes it as a whole number — that use is itself a reader | converts ← ×100 |

> **⛔ NO getter reduces, and there are NO discrete carve-outs — every channel works identically (owner ruling).**
> This uniformity IS the rework: *"then we never have to care about what format inside the structure."* A getter that
> reduces internally hands every consumer a pre-rounded number whether or not it wants one, and a consumer needing
> precision cannot get it back — which is the same shoehorn as a `getX`+`getX100` pair, just spelled differently.
> Discreteness is a property of a USE (the game unassigns whole citizens), not of a getter.
>
> **⛔ And the NAME never carries the scale (owner ruling): no `100` suffix on any internal getter / function /
> member.** Every value is ×100 by the universal rule above, so a `100` in the name is redundant noise —
> `getScalar` / `sum` / `expectedModifier`, never `getScalar100`. The one algebra rule universal ×100 brings:
> **never multiply two ×100 values together without rescaling** — the product is ×10000, so a `÷100` belongs at
> the multiply. No site is believed to do this today; any found is a defect to flag, never a silent rescale.

**Why ×100 out to the consumers, not reduced at the getter** ([the ×100 fixed-point model](#1-the-model--integer-100-for-amounts-human-only-at-the-in-and-out-boundaries)):
reducing at the getter forces a human-variant getter (a `getX`+`getX100` split) the moment anything internal needs
the ×100 form, and it lets the cascade be shoehorned into legacy-shaped getters instead of the consumers being
rewired — the exact reflex that produced the half-migration. Carrying ×100 out makes format-tracking unnecessary
(the answer is always "×100"), and the visible-100×-if-mis-wired forcing function makes every consumer wire
correctly or be discarded. **Blast radius is never a reason to limit the conversion.** A consumer that only tests
SIGN or ranks is scale-invariant (no change); one that mixes with a whole count reduces at that use; an aggregate
stays ×100 and its own reader reduces. The conversion METHOD is §4c-bis below.

**Consequence:** a ×100 value in a JSON file is a **curator bug** — it leaked an integer-math
representation onto the human surface. Because the curator absorbs all scale mixing once, readJson has
ZERO per-FIELD scale knowledge — it reads only the authored **UNIT** (`flat`/`percent`/`multiplier`, which the
data states outright), never which field it belongs to. The per-field registry below is therefore a
**curator-only, used-once** checklist — it must not leak into readJson or the cascade.

## 1b. ⛔ WIDTH IS PER UNIT TOO — amounts are 64-bit, percents are 32

Scale is decided per UNIT (§1); so is **width**, for the same reason and along the same line.

- **An AMOUNT accumulates** — across sources, across scopes, at ×100 — so it carries **`int64_t`**: the package's
  flat dictionary and its receiver sums, and every accumulator, parameter and return on the calc surface.
- **A PERCENT does not accumulate into anything** — it is a small whole number by ruling (no decimals, hence no
  ×100), so it stays **`int`**. Widening it would buy nothing and cost storage on every scope object.

⛔ **`long` IS NOT A WIDER TYPE HERE.** On the frozen VC7.1/x86 toolchain `long` is 32 bits — the tree typedefs
`int64_t` as `long long` for exactly that reason. A `long` accumulator therefore *reads* as deliberate headroom
and provides none, which is precisely how the ceiling stayed invisible: the calc surface was written in `long`
throughout and was int32 the whole time.

⚑ **The tell that the ceiling was already being hit is a PARALLEL 64-BIT TWIN.** `getModifiedIntValue64`,
`intSqrt64`, `intPow64`, `applySMRank64` exist beside their 32-bit originals, and the money plane
(`calculatePreInflatedCosts` / `getFinalExpense` / `getInflationCost` / `calcCorporateMaintenance` /
`getHurryGold` / `getRealPopulation`) is already `int64_t`. That is the same signature as a surviving fudge
factor (§4c-bis), one level up: **a duplicated surface exists because two WIDTHS meet**, exactly as a magic
constant exists because two SCALES meet. Widening the amount plane is what lets those twins be deleted rather
than extended.

⚖ **Storage is per-unit; the CALC SURFACE is 64-bit throughout.** Inside a calculation every intermediate is
`int64_t` regardless of which side it came from, so no intermediate can overflow and no mixed-width promotion
has to be reasoned about. The per-unit rule governs what is STORED (where the memory cost is), never the local
arithmetic.

⚠ **Widening costs no save work at all.** The cascade plane serializes nothing
([derived data is never trusted from a save](../save.md#5-derived-data-serializes-nothing-)), and a **serialized**
field widens SOFTLY because the save READER absorbs the narrower stored form — keep the member, the name and the
tag ([save.md §8](../save.md)). So width is decided on the merits of the value, never traded against migration
cost.

## 2. The unit table (what readJson does)

| JSON (human) | meaning | internal | combine |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flat: 7` (or `7.5`) | additive +7.00 / +7.50 | `700` / `750` (×100 — an AMOUNT) | summed: `Σflat100` |
| `percent: 25` | +25% | **`25` — NOT scaled** (a percent has no decimals) | summed: `Σpercent`, applied as `(100 + Σpercent)/100` |
| `multiplier: 2` (or `1.5`) | ×2.00 / ×1.50 | `200` / `150` (×100 — identity 100) | product: `Π(mult100/100)` |

⛔ **readJson is the ONE place that knows this, and a CALCULATION never scales (owner):** *"you should not need
to scale any value inside any actual calculation — it is literally readJson's job to ensure it's scaled."* The
unit-aware conversion lives at the parse edge (`CvModifiers.cpp`, the entry-value sites); every consumer then
receives what it can use directly. A `/100` or a `×100` appearing inside a calculation to make two operands
agree is the defect, never the fix.

## 3. How to figure a field's scale (the method — do NOT eyeball the name)

A legacy field is **per-100 (÷100 to humanize)** iff its value flows **into a ×100 accumulator with no
`× 100` on the way in** — i.e. the engine treats the stored integer as already-scaled. It is **normal
(×1, human)** iff the engine multiplies it by 100 when depositing. The tell is at the consumption site:

- `getYieldRate100` (`CvCity.cpp`) — the tell lives wherever the rate is composed. While the getter computes the
  legacy two-tier shape in place, read it there; once the channel is on the cascade the tell moves into the package
  computation. Either way, confirm the SCALE at the site that composes the value, never at the getter's name.
- `getExtraYield100` (`CvCity.cpp:10408`) just returns `getBuildingExtraYield100` — building-extra only, no
  other term. The tell lives in `getBuildingExtraYield100`
  (`CvCity.cpp:10360`): `100 * kBuilding.getYieldChange(eYield) + kTeam.getBuildingYieldTechChange(eYield, eB)`
  — the `× 100` on `getYieldChange` proves that field is human-scale going in (§4a); `getBuildingYieldTechChange`
  is already ×100 (§4b).

## 4. The per-field scale REGISTRY

### 4a. Already-human (×1) — emit as-is
| field | accessor | why ×1 |
|---|---|---|
| `YieldChange` / `CommerceChange` | `getYieldChange` / `getCommerceChange` | deposited `× 100` by the engine |
| `YieldModifier` / `CommerceModifier` | `getYieldModifier` … | an integer **percent** (emit `percent`) |

### 4b. The CLOSED per-100 set — ÷100 to humanize
Verified exhaustive: `grep -rE "get[A-Za-z_]+100 *\(" SourceArchive/Infos/*.h` returns **exactly six** `…100()`
accessors across the legacy Info headers (curator input only — the classes were moved to `SourceArchive/`
per the red-ratchet; see [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)). That set IS the de-scale list:

| field | accessor | scale | curator action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TechYieldChanges` (Building) | `getTechYieldChanges100` | ×100 | ÷100 → human (FLAT) |
| `TechCommerceChanges` (Building) | `getTechCommerceChanges100` | ×100 | ÷100 → human; it is **FLAT** (`changeBuildingCommerceTechChange`→`getBaseCommerceRate100`, `CvCity.cpp:12136`); the XML "CommercePercents" sub-tag is a misnomer |
| `EraCommerceChanges` (Heritage) | `getEraCommerceChanges100` | ×100 | ÷100 → human |
| `iExtraUpkeep100` (Promotion / UnitCombat) | `getExtraUpkeep100` | ×100 | ÷100 → human |
| `getTotalModifiedCombatStrength100` (CvUnit) | — | ×100 | **computed**, not an XML field — nothing to de-scale |

### 4c. The ×100-space ADDENDS that LACK a `…100()` getter — the heuristic's blind spot
The "`*100` getters mark the scaled fields" rule is INCOMPLETE: some fields are added in ×100 space
*without* a `…100()` getter. These must be mapped at the consumption site, not by name. Verified against
`CvCity.cpp`:

| field | scale | evidence | curator action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BonusCommercePercentChanges` (Building) | **×100, and FLAT** | added raw beside `100 * getBuildingCommerce` inside `getBuildingCommerce100` (`CvCity.cpp:12132`); the *rate* modifier is the separate `m_aiBonusCommerceRateModifier` | ÷100 de-scale **+ relabel `percent`→`flat`** (the name's "Percent" is a misnomer) |
| `YieldPerPopChange` / `CommercePerPopChange` (per-pop) | **×1 human, NOT ×100** | added raw into the ×100-space `getExtraYield100` / `getBuildingCommerce100` (`CvCity.cpp:11323` / `:12132`) — the legacy "latent /100 weakening" | **emit as-is; do NOT de-scale** (÷100 here corrupts `1/pop` → `0.01/pop`) |
| `YieldsProduced` / `CommercesProduced` (Corporation) | **×100** | `getCorporationYieldByCorporation` (`CvCity.cpp:12594-12602`): `produced × Σ getNumBonuses(prereqBonus) × worldCorpMaintPct / 100`, then the corp result `/100` — so `produced=75` ⇒ 0.75/bonus. NOT the genuinely-×1 `*Changes` twin (`getYieldChange × 100` in-formula) | ÷100 de-scale → human (`curate_corporation`). The dedicated corp pass also verifies + de-scales `iMaintenance` (`calculateCorporationMaintenanceTimes100`, ×100) |
| `iHealthPercent` / `iHappinessPercent` (Specialist) | **×100, and FLAT** | `processSpecialist` STORES them raw (`CvCity.cpp:5184/5192`, `change*Health/*Happiness(field × count)`) — the misleading part — but the REALIZED `goodHealth()`/`badHealth()`/`happyLevel()`/`unhappyLevel()` read them `/100` (`CvCity.cpp:5848/5876/5714/5654`). The `/100` is NOT AI-only weighting; it is the actual realized level. | ÷100 de-scale → human (FLAT; the "Percent" is a misnomer). `curate_specialist`. ⚠ Map at the CONSUMER, not the store — the raw `change*` store site is the trap that produces a wrong "it's FLAT ×1" correction |

> The per-pop row is the [the no-guessing rule](../../../AGENTS.md#conduct) case in miniature:
> the scale was *mapped* at the consumption site, never guessed from the field name.

### 4c-rev. ⛔ TWO SCALES IN ONE TAG — the RevolutionDCM mods

`fRevIdxNationalityMod` · `fRevIdxGoodReligionMod` · `fRevIdxBadReligionMod` · `fRevViolentMod`
(Civic + Trait). RevolutionDCM consumes them as **`1.0 + mod`** (`Revolution.py`; `violentMod` as a fraction of
the always-violent threshold), so the number carries a PERCENTAGE either way — but legacy authored it on **two
incompatible scales in the same tag**:

| population | form | example |
|---|---|---|
| the CIVICS + the BASE trait file | a RATIO | `0.5` = +50% |
| the **Thunderbrd trait module** | PERCENT POINTS | `40` = +40% — which legacy fed to `1.0 + mod` as **41×** |

⚖ **OWNER RULING: they all mean PERCENT POINTS.** The ratio population converts (×100) and the module's values
pass through — TB *"does not follow any spec, plan, or any kind of coherent structure … we make sure it does
now"*, so the incoherence is normalized AT THE CURATOR and never reaches the data.
⚠ **This is a stated BEHAVIOUR change** ([validation.md](../validation.md)): the TB traits stop being ~11–41×
multipliers. It is currently INERT — no leaderhead authors a trait — and bites the moment the community does.
⛔ The two populations are **disjoint by an order of magnitude** (ratios reach 2.0, points start at 10), so the
boundary is exact over the authored data rather than a judgement re-made per value. A value landing in the gap
is a scale nobody has ruled on: `curate_common.ratio_to_percent` **RAISES** instead of guessing.
⚑ The reader divides once, at its own point of use (`RevUtils._revModRatio`), turning the whole percent back
into the ratio the index formulas want.
⚠ The three `CvPlayer` float accumulators these also feed (`m_fRevIdx*Mod`) have **no readers at all** — the
Python side reads `INFO.getRevolution(...)` directly — so they are inert here and belong to the
writerless-accumulator sweep, not to this scale question.

## 4c-bis. ⛔ CONVERT BY ARITHMETIC CLUSTER, NEVER BY GETTER

**A getter cannot be converted alone.** Its co-operands are on the same scale *by arithmetic necessity*: convert one
side and every mixing site needs a compensating `÷100` — manufacturing the very fudge factor that signals a
misplaced reduce. Convert the whole cluster and the mixing sites need **no change at all**, because the units
already cancel. This is why such a sweep keeps getting re-shoehorned: each getter looks independently convertible,
and none is.

**The acceptance gate per cluster: ZERO new fudge factors at the mixing sites.** If a conversion forces compensating
constants, the cluster boundary was drawn WRONG — stop and redraw it, never push through. (This is the second of
[AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)'s drift detectors, stated as a conversion method.)

⚑ **A fudge factor points AT the unmigrated consumer (owner).** In practice the constant is not a mis-drawn
boundary in the abstract — it is **legacy being forced into the new surface at an AI call site**: the multiplier
exists so a consumer that has not moved can keep reading a new-surface value in its old shape. ⛔ So when one turns
up, do not ask where the conversion belongs — ask **WHICH SIDE IS STILL LEGACY**, and re-point that side. The
constant then deletes itself, and it takes its scale question with it: a hand-rolled sum is the only thing that
ever needed to know its operands' units, so re-pointing DISSOLVES the question rather than answering it.
⚠ The failure mode is the opposite move — adding the multiplier and calling it done. That leaves the AI half on
legacy while the surface beneath it moves, which is exactly the half-migrated state
[build a new getter surface, never widen a legacy one](../../architecture/patterns.md#-the-two-read-roles--one-grammar-two-answers-owner) names.

⚑ **A cluster is defined by what MIXES, not by what looks similar.** Worked groupings: the yield/food/wellbeing
chain is one unit because food consumption subtracts angry population and health rate; commerce joins it at the
production→commerce term; gold/maintenance/upkeep joins commerce because gold IS a yield
([every modifiable number is a yield](../../cascade.md#1-one-step-deposit-down-accumulate-read-o1)); unit experience is genuinely
self-contained and so is the one safely parallelizable cluster.
⚠ **Same SHAPE is not same NATURE:** a `…Times100` on AI unit counts or plot strength carries *fractional
SizeMatters counts*, not a modifier channel — it is not a scale violation and must not be swept in with the yields.

**Sequencing within a cluster (owner): set the mechanic up to spec FIRST, then wire the consumers.** Do not open
with a hundred consumer edits; build the value chain so it is internally ×100-consistent, then reduce at the readers.

### 4c-unit. ⛔ ASK THE KIND'S UNIT, NEVER THE FAMILY'S

`mod_valueForUnit` returns a `CASC_UNIT_PERCENT` as a PLAIN HUMAN PERCENT; a FLAT is ×100 and reduces at its
point of use. ⚠ **A family-wide blanket on a per-kind-split family produced every defect in that cluster** — the
unit belongs to the KIND, so reading it off the family is how a percent gets scaled or a flat does not.

### 4c-zero. ⛔ NO EXCEPTIONS — AN INDIVISIBLE QUANTITY IS STILL ×100 INTERNALLY (owner)

> *"If I had allowed for free specialists to not be a ×100 number internally, it is a virtual guarantee that
> some agent would bullshit their way through and decide more numbers should be like that."*

**THE UNIT TABLE IN §2 IS THE WHOLE VOCABULARY: `flat` (×100), `percent` (unscaled), `multiplier` (×100).
There is no COUNT unit and none is to be added.** Anything authored on an info as a `flat` is an AMOUNT and
takes the ×100, whatever it counts.

⚑ **FREE SPECIALISTS ARE THE WORKED CASE, and the argument that gets made for exempting them is the one to
refuse.** A free specialist is authored on an info as a flat — *technically a yield* (owner) — so it is ×100
like every other authored amount. The tempting objection is that a specialist is a person and half of one does
not exist, so the two decimals carry nothing; that is true and it is not a reason. ⛔ **The rule's value is
that it has NO exceptions (owner): *"if I had allowed for free specialists to not be a ×100 number internally,
it is a virtual guarantee that some agent would bullshit their way through and decide more numbers should be
like that."*** An exemption argued well for one field is a precedent the next agent widens.
⚠ **THE COST IS MEASURED, not hypothetical, which is why the argument is spelled out rather than left to
judgement.** A parse-edge carve-out exempting the count-by-type leaf from the ×100 left info-authored counts
unscaled while the unattributed ledger was lifted to meet them — so every derivable slot floored to zero at the
read edge and roughly **200 buildings authoring `freeSpecialists` granted nothing at all**. The carve-out's own
justification generalised past specialist slots to "population and era" in the same sentence it was written,
which is the widening in miniature: state and authored data reasoned about as one thing.
⛔ **POPULATION IS NOT A COUNTER-EXAMPLE — IT IS NOT FROM AN INFO (owner).** It is engine state read by a
`per:` count-scaler ([json.md §3.1](../json.md)), never an authored deposit, so it never enters this table at
all. "X is a count" is therefore never an argument about a deposit's scale; the question is only ever whether
the value is AUTHORED ON AN INFO.

### 4c-bis. ⛔ ×100 EVERYWHERE INTERNALLY — TRUNCATE ONCE, AT THE EDGE (owner)

> *"This, right here, is why we truncate once, at edge — and use ×100 everywhere internally."*

The ×100 exists so an amount can carry two decimals **to the edge**. A `÷100` anywhere before that edge throws
those decimals away, and if it happens inside an AGGREGATION it throws them away once **per term**.

> **`Σ trunc(xᵢ) ≠ trunc(Σ xᵢ)`** — and the gap grows with the number of terms.

⇒ **A value stays ×100 through every intermediate step — every sum, every per-item calculation, every hand-off
between systems — and reduces exactly once, at the surface that shows it.** An intermediate truncation is a
DEFECT even when each individual truncation is "only" a rounding, because the error is systematic (always
downward) and multiplies by the term count.

⚑ **The worked case, and it is what forced this to be written down: the trade-route list against the food /
production tooltip.** Both were internally consistent and neither had a missing modifier. The LIST was already
right — it sums the per-route yields on the ×100 plane and renders hundredths. The **STORE** was the defect:
`CvCity::updateTradeRoutes` reduced the city's whole trade contribution to a WHOLE UNIT before handing it over,
and the combine then lifted it back ×100 to fold it into TIER-1 BASE. The fraction was not deferred to the edge,
it was destroyed — and the percent stack then multiplied the loss.
⚖ **So the reduce belonged at neither end of that round trip.** The repair is the general one: the stored value
is ×100 like every other amount, the fold is a plain add, and each reader divides at its own point of use.
⚠ **Note which side "looks" wrong and is not.** The per-item surface is the one a reader suspects first, because
it visibly divides once per row; but a per-row render is the EDGE doing its job. Ask which value goes on to be
CONSUMED, and check its scale there.

⚠ **The tell to recognise:** two surfaces reporting the same quantity, each defensible on its own arithmetic,
disagreeing by an amount that scales with how many things were added up. That is not a missing deposit; it is a
reduction in the wrong place.

> **⛔ AN ALWAYS-DEFINED COMPILE GUARD IS WHERE THIS CLASS HIDES, AND IT HID FOR FIFTEEN YEARS.** The reduce sat
> inside `#ifdef _MOD_FRACTRADE`, a guard defined unconditionally in `fbuild.bff` since the mod inherited it — so
> the `#else` half had never once compiled, and the live half read as *one arm of a fractional-vs-whole switch*
> rather than as a plain `÷100` inside an aggregation. A reduce that looks like a deliberate mode is a reduce
> nobody audits.
> ⚑ **The general form, and it is the INVERSE of the attic test** ([AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) Conventions

### 4c-ter. The COMBAT-STRENGTH cluster — the target shape (owner ruling)

⚖ **"The strength legs should not need to reduce to human until actually SHOWN IN THE UI."** Combat strength is an
AMOUNT, so it is ×100 all the way through the calculation and reduces ONLY at the OUT boundary.

**What that fixes, and why the current shape is worse than a stray divide.** Today `baseCombatStr()` returns a
**different SCALE depending on a GAME OPTION** — ×100 under `GAMEOPTION_COMBAT_SIZE_MATTERS`, human without it —
and `baseCombatStrNonGranular()` exists only to undo that. A read whose scale depends on live game state cannot be
reasoned about at any call site, and it means every consumer is already wrong under one option or the other.

**The target:**
- **Strength is ×100 internally, ALWAYS — independent of any game option.** `baseCombatStrPreCheck` keeps both
  legs ×100 (no reduce on the base seed, none on the resolved delta) and drops the `*= 100` that currently
  re-manufactures the scale under SIZE_MATTERS; SizeMatters then simply scales an already-×100 value.
- **ONE human accessor at the boundary**, and it is the ONLY `÷100` — for the UI, the `Cy*` bindings and the WBS
  scenario field. `baseCombatStrNonGranular` becomes that accessor unconditionally (and should be NAMED for what
  it is: the human read, not "non-granular").
- **`m_iBaseCombat` goes ×100 with the cluster.** It is serialized, so this is a deliberate save-semantics change
  — and the WorldBuilder boundary converts, because WB edits in human units.

⛔ **It converts as ONE atomic pass, never piecemeal.** The internal reads (AI + engine) are the large majority
and stay ×100 untouched; the boundary is a handful of sites. **The audit is NOT "every call site" — it is every
site that MIXES strength with a human literal or a differently-scaled quantity.** A comparison of two strengths is
scale-invariant and needs no edit; `> 5` or `+ someHumanCount` does. ⚠ A changed scale compiles silently on the
same `int`, so the compiler is NOT the census here ([AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) drift detectors) — the mapped
mixing-site list is, and a miss surfaces only as wrong combat numbers at runtime.

## 4d. ⛔ THE EDGE — where a scale error can occur at all, and therefore what an audit checks

**A scale error cannot happen inside the cascade.** ×100 is native EVERYWHERE within it (§1), so every magnitude
there is ×100 by construction and any two operands already agree. **A scale error is only possible where a value
CROSSES A BOUNDARY** — which makes the audit an ENUMERATION OF BOUNDARIES, never a sweep over every multiply:

1. the **IN** boundary — readJson's single human→×100 conversion;
2. the **OUT** boundary — a reader's `÷100` at the point of use;
3. a **sanctioned engine INPUT** — a value the cascade folds in rather than computes.

⚑ **The trade-route fold is THE EDGE (owner)** — the exemplar of class 3 and the reason class 3 exists.
`tradeYield` is the ONE sanctioned live-yield input ([modifier.md §2a](../../cascade.md)): the cascade cannot
re-derive the trade NETWORK, so that calculation stays engine-owned ([north-star.md](../../architecture/north-star.md)
KEEP — it is none of the four systems' job) and its value is FOLDED IN. That is precisely why the scales differ
there, and why **the conversion belongs THERE: an edge converts**, exactly as the IN and OUT boundaries do.

**How to audit, since the naming ruling removed the marker.** Every value is ×100 and NO name says so, so a
grep for a `100` token returns nothing and proves nothing. Instead, at each boundary site check the two operands
against the **DECLARED scale of the surface each came from** (the calc functions' documented inputs/outputs, the
package slot reads, the compiled sums) — never against a name. ⛔ Where a boundary function mixes a plain engine
percent with a ×100 sum, fix it STRUCTURALLY — have the function lift and take both down together — so a caller
passes what it holds and cannot get the scale wrong; a comment warning the caller is not a fix.
⚠ **And never multiply two ×100 values without rescaling** — the product is ×10000, so the `÷100` belongs at the
multiply.

> **⛔ THE OUT BOUNDARY IS DECIDED PER UNIT, AND A FAMILY-WIDE `÷100` RULE IS ITSELF A DEFECT.** Within one

> **⛔ MOVEMENT IS ALREADY A PER-100 VALUE — `MOVE_DENOMINATOR` is its fixed point, and always was (owner).**

## 5. Verification — the math proves the scales, not manual JSON review

The owner cannot eyeball thousands of JSONs, so a mis-scaled field is found by the MATH: the effective value the
authored JSON produces is observed live on the `/computed` decomposition censuses, on a real save
([done = observable in the running game](../validation.md)). **Residual divergence localises
the next mis-scaled field** → fix the curator → regenerate → re-check. Exact parity is the bar — 0 in-scope mismatches; a residual divergence is a data-collection gap (a still-mis-scaled field), never a formula difference ([the completeness+attribution bar](../validation.md#the-observation-surface)).

⚖ **CALIBRATION — a scale error BREAKS BALANCE AND BEHAVIOUR, NOT THE GAME (owner).** *"It's obvious when numbers
are out of whack in a new game, and it does not actually break the game — it just breaks balance."* A wrong scale
(and the fudge factor that hides one) costs no crash and no corrupt save; it shows up on a fresh start.
⚠ **But do not read "just balance" as "just tuning."** Integer truncation does not mis-tune a mechanic, it SWITCHES
IT OFF: the AI declaring war on no difficulty, property decay never running, starting gold landing at zero. The
mechanic is absent, not weak — which is a behaviour break wearing a balance costume, and it is why these are worth
finding rather than living with.
⚑ **Read this as licence to CONVERT, not as licence to guess.** It means a well-reasoned conversion should be
made and observed rather than parked behind more analysis — over-caution here costs more than a wrong scale does,
because a mis-scaled field sitting unconverted is just as wrong and nobody is looking at it. The no-guessing rule
is unchanged: establish the unit from `infoKindUnit` + the authored data, then convert.
⛔ The exceptions that are NOT cheap, and still want care before landing: anything that changes what a SAVE means
(a serialized member's scale), and anything feeding the synchronized RNG
([the synchronized RNG is shared state](../../reference/engine.md#-the-synchronized-rng-is-shared-save-state--do-not-touch-the-draws-owner)) — those fail
silently or desync rather than looking odd.

⚑ **AND THE AI DECISION LOG IS A SCALE INSTRUMENT (owner): a decision that NEVER VARIES is a truncated-to-zero
input.** Integer division is what makes a mis-scaled value fail this way — a percent reduced by 100 lands on 0,
and the branch it gates then resolves the same way forever. Because every AI decision is logged
([spine.md](../../spine.md)), that shows up as a decision going one way 100% of the time, which is far easier to
spot than a number being quietly wrong.
⛔ So read an always-the-same AI decision as a SCALE SUSPECT first, before theorising about the AI logic — a
rand-versus-threshold that never fires, a gate that never opens, a modifier that never applies.
*(Worked: `rand(100) < declareWar.ai.percent / 100` truncated 50–100 to 0, so the AI declared war on NO
difficulty. The decision log would have shown that branch never taken; the code read as reasonable.)*
