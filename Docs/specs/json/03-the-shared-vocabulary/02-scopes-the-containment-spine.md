# 3.2 Scopes — the containment spine (always SINGULAR)

> Part of the **[03-the-shared-vocabulary](../03-the-shared-vocabulary.md)** spec.

```
world › team › empire › city › plot{improvement|feature|terrain|route} › building | specialist | unit
```

A **scope** says *where* something applies or *where* a count is taken. `empire` = the player (all their
cities). A `unit`-scope effect is a **self-accumulator** (it lands on the unit itself). A `plot`-scope effect is
the plot's own intrinsic output. One off-spine scope exists: **`self`** — the entity's *own* build (e.g.
`buildRate.self` = "build *this* entity faster"), not a place in the containment hierarchy. *(Distinct from the
`SELF` count token in §3.1.)*
