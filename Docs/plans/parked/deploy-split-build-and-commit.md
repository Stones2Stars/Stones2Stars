# Parked — split the deploy into separate build and commit scripts

> **Parked (owner):** *"we can consider running build and commit in 2 separate scripts, if that is required, but

## The intent

`Tools/CI/DeployBuild.bat` is one script that does everything: stamp the version, compile `FinalRelease`, check
out SVN, pack the FPKs, stage, generate changelogs, **commit in batches**, then mirror to GitHub. The idea is to
cut it at the commit boundary — one script that PRODUCES the payload, a second that PUBLISHES it.

## What would make it worth doing

The commit phase is the only part that talks to a server that can fail for reasons entirely outside this repo.
Everything before it is deterministic local work, and a `FinalRelease` build is ~8 minutes of it.

So the trigger is **the cost of a retry**. Today a batch that fails takes the whole deploy with it, and the
recovery is re-running the build — which redoes those 8 minutes to reach a commit step that may only have had a
few batches left. That is accepted: batch failures are not currently a recurring event, and a re-run is a
one-click operation that resolves it correctly (the working copy is checked out fresh and `svn status`
recomputes from the server, so only what had not landed is resent —
[release-deploy.md](../../reference/release-deploy.md)).

**If SourceForge failures become frequent enough that re-running builds is a real tax, split the scripts** so a
publish can be retried on its own against an already-built payload.

⚑ **The likeliest trigger is the #430 migration release.** Landing the full regenerated `Assets/Data` — over
13000 JSON files — is **guaranteed** to fail as a single transaction (owner), which is precisely what the
batching exists for. But it is also the largest batch count the pipeline will ever run, so it carries the
highest chance that *some* batch fails mid-sequence, and it is where the cost of re-running an 8-minute build
to resume is felt hardest. If the split is ever going to earn itself, that is the release that proves it.

## What NOT to do

- ⛔ **Do not split it as a refactor for tidiness.** The two halves share a great deal of state — `%build_dir%`,
  `%C2C_VERSION%`, the generated `commit_desc.md`, the temporary git tag the changelog generator needs — and
  splitting means that state has to be handed between two processes. That is real work, and it buys nothing
  until retry cost is the actual problem.
- ⛔ **Do not treat a batch failure as evidence the split is needed.** Re-running the build is the sanctioned
  repair. The split becomes justified by the FREQUENCY of failures, never by a single one.
- ⛔ **Do not add pacing or delays between batches on the theory that the server needs to catch up.** The 504
  lands on the MERGE request, after every file has already been uploaded — nothing is contending
  ([release-deploy.md](../../reference/release-deploy.md)).
