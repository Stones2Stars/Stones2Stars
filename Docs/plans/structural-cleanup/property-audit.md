# Property source-data migration — LOCKED SPEC

> **⚖ THE GOVERNING MODEL — EACH PROPERTY IS A CHANNEL IN THE CASCADE, AND THE CASCADE FEEDS WHEREVER THE
> PROPERTIES ARE SUPPOSED TO GO.** That is not a new axis: it is
> [every modifiable number is a yield](../../cascade/01-deposit-and-read.md#1-one-step-deposit-down-accumulate-read-o1) applied to the plane it already

> [cascade.md](../../cascade.md) already carries `PROPERTY_*` as one channel
> per property info in the minted channel sets.
> ⇒ **The line falls where the WORK differs, and both halves keep their owner:**
> - **the CASCADE owns WHICH SOURCES APPLY and their summed per-turn contribution** — a maintained sum like any

> - **the PROPERTY ENGINE owns INTEGRATING that rate** — decay, spatial diffusion, the solver's ordered
>   predict/compute/correct/apply. Untouched, owner-locked, exactly as the mandate below says.
> ⚑ **This IS "feed the engine, do not remodel it"** — the engine keeps every piece of math it owns and stops
> re-discovering its inputs. ⛔ So it is NOT licence to touch the solver, the decay curve or the propagators.
> ⚠ **What it supersedes is the per-turn REDISCOVERY, not the bridge's job.** `CvPropertySolver::doTurn` today

> ⇒ **Consequence for the EMPIRE-SCOPE FAN below: do NOT patch it into `foreachManipulator`.** Under the channel

> Consequences:
> - The curator's fold of `<Properties>` (city) into the `PROPERTY_X.city.flat` families **IS the decided model**
>   (`curate_building.py` — NO curator change), and the bridge feeding them to the per-turn solver is CORRECT —
>   incl. the 353 flammability adders, GERM_TRAPS' disease +25, GARDENS_BY_THE_BAY's air −50.
> - The engine's one-shot held path (`processBuilding` add/subtract via `getProperties()`/
>   `getPropertiesAllCities()`, `CvCity.cpp:4717`) stays STUB-FED — now correct by ruling: nothing is held.
> - **Increment 5 REVIVES for the 6 `<PropertiesAllCities>` entries** (curated `PROPERTY_X.empire.flat` — the
>   fire services etc., now per-turn in EVERY city of the owner): the bridge reads `empire`-scope families into
>   an all-cities manipulator container on the building, and `CvGameObjectCity::foreachManipulator` additionally
>   walks the owning player's buildings for those (count-scaled — one gather per instance, mirroring the legacy
>   per-instance add). NO player-scope manipulator source exists in the XML (census: DEFAULT 2210 / CITY 79 /
>   PLOT 72), so this gather serves exactly these converted one-shots.
>
> **⚠ FOUND (mapFrom idempotency): the increment-1/2 bridges were append-only** — the aliased full-registry
> `mapFrom` re-run duplicated every property source ~3× (live-verified: ANCIENT_CUSTOMS 9 sources for 3 authored).
> Fixed: `CvPropertyManipulators::clear()` + clear-and-refill at the top of each bridge walk (the CvInfo.h

>
> **THE CARRIER BRIDGES (stubbing is straight up not allowed):** every legacy

## The five legacy source channels (all stub-empty today)

1. Property's **own** decay + population baseline + spatial diffusion — `CvPropertyInfo::m_PropertyManipulators`.
2. Property's **change-propagation** table (City→Player rollup) — `CvPropertyInfo::getChangePropagator` (`CvPropertyInfo.h:31`).
3. **Building** flat/conditioned deposits — `CvBuildingInfo::m_PropertyManipulators` (`CvBuildingInfo.h:611`).
4. **Unit** flat deposits (emit to the unit's city+plot) — `CvUnitInfo::m_PropertyManipulators` (`CvUnitInfo.h:546`).
5. Corporation deposits — `CvCorporationInfo::m_PropertyManipulators`. **Zero real data anywhere** (XML or JSON) — a
   stub matching an empty legacy reality; leave stubbed, nothing to migrate.

## Legacy target classes (READ-ONLY — never touch the solving math)

- `CvPropertySource.h` + `.cpp`: `CvPropertySourceConstant` (`IntExpr* m_pAmountPerTurn` — the FLAT kind),
  `CvPropertySourceDecay` (`iPercent` self-decay toward `iNoDecayAmount`), `CvPropertySourceAttributeConstant`
  (`ATTRIBUTE_POPULATION × iAmountPerTurn` — the population baseline). `CvPropertySourceConstantLimited` = **dead**
  (0 real data).
- `CvPropertyPropagator.h`+`.cpp`: `CvPropertyPropagatorDiffuse` (`.cpp:420-543`) — the ONLY live propagator (equalizes
  a % of source↔target difference/turn). `Spread`/`Gather` = **dead** (0 real data).
- `CvPropertyInteraction.*` = **dead** (0 real data — `PropertyInteractionType` is schema-only).
- `CvPropertyManipulators.h`+`.cpp`: the container (`vector<CvPropertySource*/Interaction*/Propagator*>`, `addSource`
  factory `.cpp:58-79`). **Only an XML `read()` populates it — NO programmatic construction path exists.**
- `CvPropertySolver.*`: the authoritative integrator, `CvGame.cpp:6008` calls `doTurn()` once/turn. Untouched.
- **Manipulator gather roster** — `CvGameObject.cpp:626-747`: City walks its OWN `getHasBuildings()` (`:666`),
  present religions/corps/specialists; Unit walks its UnitInfo + promotions; Plot walks terrain/feature/improvement/
  route/bonus; Player walks civics/stateReligion/traits/heritage/handicap. ⚠ **No path rolls an `empire`-scope
  building deposit to every city** (owner-decision #3 below).

## What the JSON already carries (curated — bridge only, no shape change)

- **Property own decay + population baseline** in `Assets/Data/properties/*.json` (7 files): decay = `PROPERTY_X.city.percent`
  / `.plot.percent`; population baseline = `PROPERTY_X.city.flat:{value,per:{type:POPULATION,each}}`. Matches XML exactly.
  > **⚖ FLAMMABILITY AUTHORS NEITHER — ITS BASELINE IS 0.** No decay, no population baseline — the
  > city's flammability is a PURE ACCUMULATOR over its source deltas: the per-turn building adders push it up
  > and the reducers pull it down, and nothing else moves it. ⚖ A REAL decay/baseline for it is a LATER owner
  > design decision, not a gap to fill by matching the siblings — the owner also notes flammability is a bit
  > too NARROW as a property compared to the others, so the shape may be revisited wholesale. ⛔ Until that
  > decision, do not author a decay or baseline into `property_flammability.json`.
  > ⚑ Consequence to hold when reading a city's value: under the per-turn model a fresh game (or a save whose
  > sessions predate the source feed) legitimately reads 0 everywhere until turns have run — an empty
  > flammability row is the accumulator starting from its 0 baseline, not evidence the feed is broken.
- **Building/unit flat deposits**: ordinary `PROPERTY_*` modifier families — `PROPERTY_X.city.flat` / `.plot.flat` —
  on ~250 building + 114 unit files. Verified exact vs XML (`building_3d_printing_mill` air-pollution +2;
  `unit_police_dog` crime city −5/plot −3 = the implicit unit `RELATION_SAME_PLOT`).
- **Genuine authoring gaps** (need curator + the new block): spatial **diffusion** (nothing in JSON), the one
  **changePropagation** (`PROPERTY_FLAMMABILITY` City→Player 100%), and the `properties`-block gate predicates.

## APPROVED JSON shape — the `properties` bespoke section (json.md §9 reserves the name)

On the property's own entity (`Assets/Data/properties/<X>.json`):

```jsonc
"properties": {
  "diffuse": [
    { "from": "city", "to": "plots", "relation": "near", "distance": 1, "percent": 5 },
    { "from": "plot", "to": "city", "relation": "samePlot",              "percent": 10 },
    { "from": "plot", "to": "plots", "relation": "near", "distance": 1, "percent": 4, "enabled": "IS_OWNED" }
  ],
  "changePropagation": [ { "from": "city", "to": "empire", "percent": 100 } ]  // FLAMMABILITY only
}
```

- `from`/`to` = the two objects (diffuse is two-object, unlike a `grants` pulse); `relation`+`distance` mirror the
  `grants` property-pulse vocabulary (§5). `enabled` = an ordinary condition (§3.4/§3.5).
- The legacy `PLOT→PLOT` `Active` tag-BoolExpr gates map onto EXISTING json.md predicates (no new predicates):
  `TAG_OWNED`→`IS_OWNED`/vicinity-owned, `TAG_PEAK`→`HAS_PEAK`, `TAG_WATER`+`TAG_CITY`→`{all:["IS_WATER",…]}`.
  Curator applies a fixed translation table.

## Implementation (one landing)

### A. Engine — one small ADDITIVE method (no solver/read/math change)

`CvPropertyManipulators` (+ `CvPropertySource`/`CvPropertyPropagator`): add a **programmatic constructor path** —
e.g. `addConstantSource(PropertyTypes, int iAmount, GameObjectTypes=NO_GAMEOBJECT, RelationTypes=NO_RELATION, int
iData=0, const BoolExpr* =NULL)`, `addDecaySource(...)`, `addAttributeConstantSource(...)`, `addDiffusePropagator(...)`
— mirroring the `addSource(PropertySourceTypes)` factory (`.cpp:58-79`) but building the object graph directly. This is
the ONLY engine touch (plus B3, C3 below). Does not touch `read()`, `CvPropertySolver`, or any predict/correct math.

### B. Pocos — `mapFrom` bridge (after `CvInfo::mapFrom` has parsed `m_modifiers`)

1. **Building** (`CvBuildingInfo.cpp:336`-ish, mirror the river/plot-type array bridge at `:71-90`) + **Unit**
   (`CvUnitInfo.cpp:336`): walk `getModifiers()->entries()`; for each `PROPERTY_*.{city|plot}.flat` `CvModEntry`,
   `jsonResolveId` the property, then:
   - plain (`!hasPer && !enabled && !disabled`) → `addConstantSource(prop, value100/100, [unit: GAMEOBJECT_CITY|PLOT +
     RELATION_SAME_PLOT])`.
   - per/conditioned → build the `IntExpr`(`per:{POPULATION,each}` → `IntExprMult(IntExprAttribute(POPULATION),
     const)`) and/or the `BoolExpr` via the translator (B3) — do NOT drop or always-apply (the ~44 conditioned
     building files: Folklore tech-gates, Foundling-Hospital per-pop).
2. **PropertyInfo** (`CvPropertyInfo.cpp:29-91`): own-family walk → decay (`.city.percent`→`addDecaySource`),
   population baseline (`.city.flat` +`per:POPULATION`→`addAttributeConstantSource`); + read the new
   `properties.diffuse[]`→`addDiffusePropagator` and `properties.changePropagation[]`→the `getChangePropagator` table.
3. **JSON→legacy-BoolExpr translator** (NEW, small, scoped — owner-decision #1/#2 APPROVED): translate a
   `CvCondition` (the pocos' `enabled`/`disabled`) into a legacy `const BoolExpr*` for the known predicate set
   (the 4 diffuse tag-gates + the building tech-gates). One `BoolExprIs`-shaped node type; NOT a general bridge.

### C. Curator + data

1. Emit `properties.diffuse[]` / `properties.changePropagation[]` into `Assets/Data/properties/*.json` from
   `CIV4PropertyInfos.xml` (`PROPERTYPROPAGATOR_DIFFUSE` + the one `ChangePropagators`), applying the tag→predicate
   table. Recurate + regen; commit the regenerated data.
2. **Empire-scope building props (5 files, `PROPERTY_FLAMMABILITY`)** — owner-decision #3: add a small gather in
   `CvGameObjectCity::foreachManipulator` to also walk the owning player's `empire`-scope-flagged building deposits
   (the minimal engine touch), so those 5 deliver. *(Confirm with owner at implement time if a non-engine route exists.)*

### D. Explicitly SKIP (dead legacy surface — 0 real data; not phantom gaps)

`CvPropertySourceConstantLimited`, `CvPropertyPropagatorSpread`/`Gather`, all `CvPropertyInteraction`, and Corporation
manipulators. The `PropertyBuildings` value-bands are not folded here either — they are the BUILDING's
`requires.operate` clause ([enabler.md §3](../../specs/enabler.md)), never a property-side member.

## Validate

Rebuild (Assert compile-check, then Release/agentstart), end a turn: the property sources are verified LIVE via the
endpoints (the per-turn `PROPERTY_*` deltas / property-source decomposition) — none lost, each attributed to a named
source; Canterbury crime/education normalise; commerce recovers on its own.
