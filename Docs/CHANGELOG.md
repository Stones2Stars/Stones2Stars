# S2S — cascade rebuild (draft changelog, 2026-08)

> **DRAFT — pending owner curation.** Content is assembled from the repo docs and the
> cascade-rebuild git history; nothing here is final until reviewed.
>
> **Maintenance:** a commit whose change a player or modder would notice appends one bullet to
> `## Unreleased` in the SAME commit (AGENTS.md Git/delivery). The `/changelog-update` skill
> digests anything that slipped, from the marker below. The old commit-message-derived
> changelog script is dead and stays dead.

## Unreleased

- **The city bar's culture line reads correctly, and no longer faults.** Hovering a city showed its culture
  against a threshold of `0`, and the culture level's name was missing — while the game quietly took an access
  violation behind the scenes, several times a session. Culture is stored as a 64-bit number (it used to overflow
  into negatives in long games); the tooltip was still handing that wide number to the game's own text formatter,
  which counts its arguments in 32-bit steps. Everything after the culture was therefore read one step early, so
  the threshold was rendered as the *level name* and the engine tried to walk it as text. On Windows the fault was
  swallowed; under Wine/Proton it need not be. The same slip is fixed in the city population line.

- **Great people can build their wonders again.** A Great Prophet's shrines, and every other "consume me to put up
  this building" action, had no button at all — the unit's list of what it may construct was being read with a
  parser that only understood the short form of an entry, so any entry written in the longer form (the one that
  can carry its own condition) was skipped without complaint. Nearly six thousand entries are written that way, so
  in practice the list was empty for every unit that had one, and a unit that can construct nothing is offered
  nothing.

- **Unit actions with an outcome work again — butchering a subdued animal above all.** Every action that resolves
  through an outcome was silently unavailable *inside your own borders*: butchering and fighting a subdued animal,
  and the whole captive repertoire (butcher, sacrifice, and joining a city as a slave). The button did not grey
  out, it was simply absent, because an action nothing can perform is never offered. Outcomes each carry a list of
  territories they are allowed in, and "your own" had been dropped from all of them — an outcome that names no
  territory is allowed nowhere, and the vast majority never named one because permission at home was the thing you
  never had to write down. ⚑ Modders: `territory` on an outcome now always states the full allowed set. It is only
  ever written to DENY; leaving it out no longer means "nowhere".

- **A building is never obsoleted by another building — those are upgrade chains.** Every ladder in the game
  (bridges, gatherers, medicine, arenas) was carrying two contradictory fates for the same successor: "destroy me
  when it exists" and "park me while it exists". 1,521 of the 1,522 buildings that named an obsoleting building
  named that same building as a dormancy source. Obsolescence is decided before the still-running check, so the
  destroy would have won — a predecessor would have been demolished the turn its successor went up, instead of
  going quiet and waking again if the successor were ever lost. Only a **tech** obsoletes a building now.
  ⚑ Modders: `obsoletedBy.buildings` is gone from the data model; a building's `obsoletedBy` carries `techs` only.
- **An obsolete building now becomes its successor instead of just vanishing.** When the tech that obsoletes a
  building lands, it upgrades into the next tier in its line rather than being demolished — the behaviour the
  original game had and that had been lost. It walks the line to find a tier you can actually take, so
  researching far past a building doesn't strand you: an ancient bridge that has been superseded four times over
  arrives at one you can hold. If you already own the successor, the old building simply goes.
  ⚑ Modders: this is `whenObsolete.becomes`, the third fate beside "vanish" (empty) and "stay with reduced
  output" (a modifier tree). It says what becomes of the building and deliberately never names what obsoleted
  it. 1,522 buildings now carry one. There is no gold-paid building upgrade and there will not be one.
- **The customizable domestic advisor works again — 12 of its 20 columns were rendering nothing.** The screen
  holds each column's read as a NAME it evaluates at draw time, so a read that no longer exists fails per column
  rather than per screen — and the draw loop caught every one of those failures and printed `draw table failure!`
  without saying which column or why, so the columns looked merely empty instead of broken. The base and global
  rank columns, the commerce columns, the wonder counts, maintenance, food difference and espionage defence all
  answer again, and the catch now names the column and the error. Saved BUG layouts still resolve — the columns
  kept their keys.
- **A sick city loses the food it should.** The unhealth penalty was being subtracted on the wrong scale, so each
  missing health cost about one hundredth of the food it was meant to — unhealth was very nearly free, and a
  plagued city grew as though it were not.
- **Loading a save no longer strips every city centre of its city yields.** The plot re-binds its identity before
  the save stream has delivered its coordinates, so after a load every centre plot answered as though it were
  somewhere else and lost the whole city block — the population term and the guaranteed minimums — on every
  channel. Food happened to land on the right number at sizes 5–9, which is why this looked like a
  production-and-commerce-only fault.
- **"Can I build this?" is asked of the one machine that knows.** 22 places asked cities and players a pair of
  questions the engine does not answer at all, and raised every time they were reached: the revolution loop,
  barbarian civilization setup, tech conquest, several random events, the victory screen and the WorldBuilder
  city editor. They now read the availability verdict directly.
- **We Love the King Day fires again** — the event that starts it called a method that does not exist, so it
  raised every time it came up. ⚑ Modders: the write lives on the action surface, not on the city; the city
  surface is read-only by design.
- **A civilization with several leaders draws the right one.** The leaderhead lookup counted every leader in the
  game into an index it then compared against a per-civilization position, so any civ past the first with more
  than one leader picked up somebody else's portrait.
- **"Deal cancelled" tells you again**, and a loaded save re-derives its trade counts from the deals it actually
  holds rather than trusting a stored tally. On the standing test save 314 deals load and the turn cancels 109,
  every one of them attributable to a named reason.
- Modders: **a resource crossing the trade network now reports how many copies moved**, not a literal 1. A source
  supplying six of a resource announced one, so anything tracking holdings off the event stream — the
  out-of-process readers above all — believed the network held a single copy and diverged further with every
  trade after the first.
- Modders: **the Python callback validator runs again, and no longer edits your data.** It was parsing 2.4-era
  source with a 3.x parser and dying on the first `print` statement, so it reported nothing; worse, on an
  unresolved callback it blanked the element and rewrote the XML in place. A validator reports — fixing is
  yours. 457 XML files against 1,644 functions in 366 Python files, clean.
- **143 unused bindings are gone from the Python API.** Every one was published to script and called from
  nowhere in the shipped Python or the map scripts — legacy surface from `CyGame`, `CyPlayer`, `CyPlot`,
  `CyMap`, the global context and the art/text managers. ⚑ Modders: if you used one, say so and it comes back
  as a read on the new surface rather than as the old binding. Nothing that Python, a map script, or the
  domestic advisor's name-table reaches was touched.
- **A city can be asked whether it is the capital, a government centre, in disorder, or under occupation.**
  All four getters existed in C++ and were never published to Python, so the ~33 places that asked — the
  revolution loop, several event triggers, the finance and corporation advisors, the occupation alert — raised
  instead of answering. ⚑ Modders: ask a city a single status question by name; the `getFlags()` list is for a
  screen that wants several bits from one fetch, such as the city bar drawing its icons.
- **`CyTeam.isHominid()` is gone from the Python API.** It was published as a second name for `isNPC` — the
  registration pointed at `CyTeam::isNPC`, so the real `isHominid` body was never reachable and the name answered
  a different question than it asked. Nothing called it. ⚑ Modders: use `isNPC()`.
- **Power checks in Python were calling a binding that was never registered.** `CyCity::isPowered()` was
  written but never published to Python, and the call sites asked for `isPower()`, which does not exist
  at all — so each raised whenever it was reached: the "unlimited power" random-event trigger, the
  Revolution index's power bonus, and the domestic advisor's power column (plus its spaceship build
  advice). `isPowered()` is now published and the call sites use it. ⚑ Modders: ask a city a single
  status question through its named getter; the `getFlags()` list is for a screen that needs many bits
  from one fetch.
- **Optics no longer claims to extend how far your ships see.** The `canSeeFurtherFromWater`
  capability (legacy `bExtraWaterSeeFrom`) is removed outright. Its effect ran through a vision
  accessor the rebuilt sight model deleted, so the ability had already stopped doing anything —
  but it was still granted, still shown in the pedia, and still made the AI value the tech and
  score coastal city sites as if it worked. Vision now answers one way, through the budget the
  observer spends walking outward. ⚑ Modders: the XML tag and its schema entry are gone; an
  observer-side sight bonus is expressed on the vision channel, not as a capability.
- **Buildings that grant a third ring of workable tiles now actually grant it.** Twelve buildings
  carry `adds3rdRing`, and nothing in the engine read it — the ring was promised in the data and
  never delivered, so those cities worked two rings like any other. The city now reads the amenity
  its buildings confer, and because that is refcounted, holding two grantors and losing one keeps
  the ring instead of dropping it.
- **Power restored** tells you again when a city's blackout ends. The message died with the
  per-turn maintainer that used to emit it.
- **A resource requirement now names ONE origin.** `connection: "trade"` means the network holds it;
  `connection: "onSite"` means the city itself supplies it — a mine, or a building that manufactures it.
  The old combined `"trade|vicinity"` form is gone: the two are genuinely different questions (a mounted
  unit needs horses on site, a swordsman only needs iron in the network), and a gate wanting either now
  states two atoms under an `any`. Shipped data is regenerated; hand-authored data using the combined
  form needs updating.
- The Heritage advisor has an **Empire** tab listing the empire-level buildings you hold. That class
  is held by the empire rather than by a city, so nothing anywhere showed it — you owned things with
  no way to see them. A held-but-dormant one is marked, since holding is not the same as working.
- Build-list tooltips show the yield and commerce ICONS again instead of spelling the channel out
  in words, so an entry reads `+6 <production>` rather than `+6 Production`.
- Hovering a worker build action shows the build's name again. Builds were the one action type
  never given a hotkey description, so the tooltip's heading came up empty.
- **Hovering a unit on the map now shows that unit.** Previously only its FLAG did: a map hover
  answered for the tile alone, so a worker's orders were readable off the flag and nowhere else.
- Unit tooltips are laid out in blocks — name, then condition, then what it is doing — instead of
  one long comma-separated line. A worker now states its build and the turns left on its own line,
  and a unit under orders with no build (walking to lay a road, say) names its mission rather than
  going silent. An idle unit still says nothing.
- A worker mid-build shows what the build will CHANGE, beside how long is left on it — the name and the
  turns say it is busy, this says whether being busy is worth it. It is the same figure the build's own
  action button advertised before you ordered it, so the two cannot disagree.
- Worker build tooltips lead with the **turns and the gold cost**. Both were already there, at the
  bottom of a long block of yield detail, which made them effectively unfindable.
- A plot tooltip names the city working the tile, while it is being worked. A plot yields either
  way, but only a worked tile feeds a city.
- Unit tooltips state what the unit COSTS to build, directly under the name — the same place a building
  has always stated its own. Comparing a unit against a building in the build list meant reading one
  price and guessing the other.
- Random events fire again. Their handlers reached the engine through info accessors that no longer
  exist, so a handler raised the moment it ran and its event did nothing — invisibly, since the
  failure lands in a log no player reads.
- Wonder movies no longer open an empty window. The screen kept per-movie state that was never set
  up when there was no movie to play (and was torn down when one finished), so it failed on every
  frame and drew nothing.
- Units handed over by a popup or by the Crusade wonder no longer receive their city's free
  experience twice. Creating a unit in a city settles that experience once, and these three paths
  were still adding it a second time on top.
- The score list works again. It threw on every screen redraw, so a newly met civilization never
  appeared in it and clicking your own name to expand it took the game down.
- Six things that had gone quietly dead now work again: the impeachment and chariotry events could
  never trigger, the Malaccan pirates arrived without their promotions or their name, wonder movies
  for terrain features would not open, and event landmark signs were not placed.
- Modders: the Python endpoint that brings a unit into existence is now `createUnit`, on both the
  player and the action surface — it was `initUnit`, which named the engine internal that callers
  must never reach directly. It now matches the engine's own single creation step, so a reader
  looking for how a unit comes into being finds one answer instead of two spellings. Every shipped
  call site moved with it, including the Python embedded in module XML.
- The tribal guardian arrives when the city is founded, and it no longer inherits the settler's
  accumulated experience. Walking a settler for three turns used to hand its guardian 33 experience
  — four turns, 44 — because the transfer read a hundredths-scaled value as whole points.
- Fixed unit experience being read a hundred times too large in several places: the great-general
  points Pergamon awards (a unit with 33 experience counted as 3,300, paying roughly ten times the
  points it should), and three random-event requirements that asked for a veteran of 7, 25 or 50
  experience and in practice accepted almost any unit.
- Units that arrive by any route other than training — granted, awarded, spawned, captured, bribed,
  founder escorts, free defenders, great people — now receive the free experience their city gives
  units, exactly as a trained unit does. Previously it depended on which code path created them.
- Units whose combat role has no promotions at all can no longer earn them: great people, subdued
  animals, workers, executives, corporate agents, nukes and captives among them (389 units). They
  kept picking up promotions through the species/size/quality classes attached to them for other
  reasons. Promotions a unit is simply *given* by its own type are unaffected. Modders: this is the
  new `unpromotable` unit tag, derived from whether any promotion accepts the unit's primary combat
  class — if something ought to promote and cannot, giving that class a promotion is the fix.
- Restored the combat-odds tooltip when hovering an attack target.
- Fixed a crash when loading a save from inside a running game.
- The city centre plot yields its guaranteed minimums again (3 food / 1 hammer / 1 commerce
  floor) instead of acting like a regular tile.
- Fixed a civilization-restriction misread that hid 21 empire-wide buildings (the rock/stick/
  lumber gatherer class and kin) from every player's build list.
- The civilization-whitelist mechanic is removed outright: what a civ can build is decided by
  its techs and requirements — NPCs included — and deliberate bars use the disable mechanism.
- Empire-wide gatherer-class buildings require their resource again (obsidian gatherer needs
  obsidian in the city vicinity, and kin) — the empire conversion had dropped those build
  requirements.
- A trait's extra-yield-threshold bonus reaches its cities again: the per-tile step was being
  applied to each plot but never added to the city's own food/hammer/commerce totals, so a
  trait that grants it changed the tile readouts and nothing the city actually produced.
- Golden ages give their per-tile bonus again (+1 hammer and +1 commerce on qualifying worked
  tiles). It had stopped applying entirely, while the AI still valued golden ages as though it
  were there. As before, a tile qualifies on what it makes *before* its improvement and route
  are counted — so a tile whose whole output comes from a mine or a road does not qualify.
- Negative traits impose their tile penalty again: the lazy, gluttonous, excessive and nomad
  lines lower the output of tiles above their threshold, which had stopped applying entirely
  while the matching bonus on positive traits kept working.
- The city yield breakdown now reports the route's share of a tile's output separately.
- Complex-trait games no longer hand a leader the base rung of a trait line *and* its rank-1 rung at the
  same time. A line now runs 1 → 2 → 3, as complex games have always been played, and a leader holds the
  rung rather than the rung plus a hidden extra copy underneath it. Leaders therefore start with the values
  their rank actually states — noticeably less in some cases, because the duplicate was stacking on top.

Stones2Stars (S2S) is a Civ4 / Caveman2Cosmos-derived mod. This release cycle is a ground-up
rebuild of how the mod computes and displays everything: all game data moved from XML to JSON,
all bonuses and requirements flow through one unified system, and the whole game state is
observable live from outside the game.

---

## For players — what feels different

### Build lists and the tech tree actually tell you why

- Buildings, units, and techs now show in three states: **available** (build now), **greyed**
  (missing something specific), or **hidden** (not unlocked yet).
- Greyed entries name exactly what you're missing — "go get copper", "research Astronomy" —
  per requirement (tech / resource / civic). Unmeetable entries are hidden instead of taunting you.
- Tech tree correctly distinguishes "not yet obtainable" from "never obtainable".
- Tech tree arrow layout fixed; tech splash screen restored.
- The build list correctly drops buildings you've already queued.

### Obsolescence and bans that behave sensibly

- New tech makes old units/buildings **obsolete**: they leave the production queue, but existing
  ones persist on the map.
- Obsoleted buildings can stay active with reduced effects, or vanish entirely — per building.
- Laws and policies can **ban** buildings (destroyed while the law holds; repeal rebuilds them)
  or block techs.
- Once a successor unit is trainable, its predecessor drops out of the build list.

### One coherent bonus system

- Food, production, gold, research, culture, espionage, happiness, health, and properties like
  pollution all flow through one unified modifier system — effects from techs, civics, traits,
  buildings, religions, and corporations combine cleanly instead of through dozens of special cases.
- Conditional effects work as advertised: "+1 happiness while powered", "−production while
  polluted", per-military-unit or per-population scaling.
- Happiness and health run a four-channel model (happiness / anger / health / unhealth); excess
  anger translates to rioting population, blocked by amenities.

### UI and information

- City and unit hover details; **ALT** shows a plot-yield breakdown.
- Building tooltips show cost and hammers already sunk.
- "Requires" tooltips name exactly what is missing, item by item.
- Five advisor screens rewired to live data.
- The Civilopedia rebuilt on the new data surface — hundreds of pedia errors eliminated.
- Leader trait display: full trait names, one per line, rendered live pre-game.
- Cities in anarchy show burning/disorder visuals.
- Promotion icons laid out in rows.
- Culture-threshold alert spam fixed.

### Game setup and difficulty

- Map scripts restored — new games generate again.
- New-game start is fully data-driven: starting units, gold, buildings, and techs come from
  start packages conditioned by era, difficulty, and civilization — and all of it announces
  correctly on game start (research popup, start techs, wellbeing cushions).
- Goody huts, traits, civics, and handicap effects all initialize and announce correctly.
- One City Challenge now removes wonder limits outright.
- Difficulty applies as a proper modifier set; flexible difficulty rewires AI advantage on the fly.

### Rules and fixes

- Golden age ends anarchy.
- Valley of the Kings requires Pyramid and Sphinx **in the same city**.
- Shrine and corporation-HQ revenue lands in the owning city.
- Random events repaired: hurricane, cyclone, champion, fires.
- Trade routes: profitability scales with civics, traits, and buildings; coastal/foreign/
  shared-civic routes get their own bonuses; route counts cap by culture level.
- Wonders cap properly as world (one per game), national (one per player), or team wonders.
- Properties like pollution auto-place and remove their band buildings as the value crosses
  thresholds — no per-turn churn.

### Performance

- Building evaluation no longer rebuilds the city per candidate.
- AI loops sweep maintained lists instead of full registries.
- Pathfinder cost fixes; runaway path searches capped.
- Specialist processing reduced roughly 40× per citizen.

## For modders — the data platform

### Everything is JSON now

- All ~13,400 game entities across 33 info types (buildings, units, techs, civics, traits,
  religions, corporations, terrain, features, improvements, routes, eras, handicaps, leaders, …)
  migrated from XML to curated JSON, loaded by one reader.
- One JSON file per entity: `Assets/Data/<Type>/<ENTITY_ID>.json`.
- **Cold-read promise**: keys say what they mean — you can read an entity file and understand it
  without engine knowledge.
- Every entity type shares the same top-level shape: availability (`enables`, `requires`,
  `allowed`), provisions (`grants`, `triggers`), effects (modifier families), and metadata.

### Availability: one machine answers "can I build it?"

- `enables` — what an entity unlocks (the forward edge: a tech lists what it opens up).
- `requires.build` — conditions to construct (greyed in the UI if unmet).
- `requires.operate` — conditions to keep running; losing them puts a building into dormancy.
- `allowed` — caps: `world: 1`, `empire: 1`, `team: 1`, or category caps by culture level.
- `obsoletes` / `replacedBy` / `disables` — soft supersession, hard unit replacement, and
  law-driven bans, each with distinct semantics.
- `whenObsolete` — a modifier tree applied to obsoleted buildings; empty means hard removal.
- Entity-level `enabled` / `disabled` gates turn whole entities on or off by game option,
  difficulty, or runtime predicate — no data removal needed.

### Modifiers: one format for every number

- Channels: `food`, `production`, `gold`, `research`, `culture`, `espionage`, `happiness`,
  `anger`, `health`, `unhealth`, `maintenance`, `defense`, `tradeRoutes`, one per property, …
- Three unit kinds per entry: `flat` (+N), `percent` (+%), `multiplier` (×), combined as
  `(base + Σflat) × (1 + Σpercent) × Π multiplier`.
- Scoped deposits: `food.empire.percent` vs `food.city.flat`; empire effects roll down to
  cities, city effects stay local; plural targets (`cities`, `plots`, `units`) name receivers.
- Count scaling: `per: {type, each, scope}` — e.g. happiness per military unit.
- Conditional entries: `enabled` / `disabled` gates on any entry, applied and withdrawn
  automatically when the condition crosses — including age gates (`existedFor`), which is how
  legacy "commerce doubles after N years" authors as a second age-gated deposit.
- Ranked subsets: `orderedBy: CITY_SIZE, max: 5` targets the five largest cities
  [spec — verify: ranked entries currently apply unranked until the selection lands].

### One condition vocabulary, used everywhere

- Combinators: `all` / `any` / `noneOf`, nesting to any depth.
- Atoms: any typed ID (`BUILDING_FORGE`, `TECH_ASTRONOMY`, `BONUS_IRON`) with optional
  `min` / `max` thresholds and explicit `scope` overrides.
- Resource connection filters: `trade` (via network), `vicinity` (radius tile), plus
  `onSite` / `owned` variants.
- Runtime predicates: `IS_CAPITAL`, `HAS_RIVER`, `IS_GOLDEN_AGE`, `HAS_POWER`, `IS_FOREIGN`,
  `SHARES_CIVIC`, parameterized forms like `{HAS_RELIGION: RELIGION_X}`,
  `{latitude: {min: 30, max: 60}}`, `{existedFor: {min: 1000}}`, and more — an extensible
  registry, not a fixed list.
- Property bands: `{type: PROPERTY_X, min: A, max: B}` gates on property value ranges.

### Grants, triggers, start packages

- `grants` — payloads delivered on an entity's considered action (research a tech, construct a
  building, adopt a civic): units, gold, buildings, free specialists, free techs, promotions.
- `triggers` — conditional recurring or event-fired effects: a `trigger` (when), a `chance`
  (odds), and an `action` (grant, spawn, property change, script call).
- Start packages (`STARTPACKAGE_*`) [spec — verify]: named grant bundles gated by era / handicap /
  civ, stacking — specced; the entity type is not built yet (starts currently ride the civilization's
  own grants).

### Classification

- **Tags**: immutable type membership on units (`military`, `air`, `ranged`, …) backing
  predicates, condition atoms, and AI classification. Extensible.
- **Skills**: mutable per-unit abilities (promotions, combat classes) that can be gained or
  lost mid-game.
- **Amenities**: city-held markers granted by buildings/civics/religions (power, freshwater,
  government center, …), used to gate deposits.
- **Capabilities**: team-held grants from techs and civics (trade routes, special units,
  diplomacy verbs).
- Vision, movement, cargo, and hide-and-seek rebuilt as data families on this classification.
- Trait lines: leaders seed both the simple and complex trait sets; a line's base trait enables
  its higher rungs; which set is active is a game option; all trait effects author on the trait itself.

### Live observability

Every state change in the game announces on an event spine, and you can watch from outside
the process:

- **HTTP endpoints** (`127.0.0.1:7227`, GET-only, loopback):
  - `/` — liveness check (`hello world`).
  - `/events` — SSE stream of live game facts (limited concurrent streams).
  - `/computed/...` — decomposition censuses: per-city tri-state building lists with reasons,
    per-entity gate verdicts with the failing leg named. `GET /computed` serves the live index.
- **Log files** (`Documents/My Games/Beyond The Sword/Logs/`):
  - `Cascade.log` — domain facts, modifier applications, grant firings; readable **while the
    game runs**.
  - `XmlLoad.log` — data load census with per-type counts.

### Extending the platform

- **New threshold condition**: `{type: TOKEN, min: N, max: M}` — no engine change needed.
- **New per-thing scaling**: `per: {type: TOKEN, each: N, scope: SCOPE}` — routed by type prefix.
- **New predicate**: define the evaluator, emit a spine fact when its state changes, register it.
- **New modifier family**: register the channel, add it to the family list, emit the spine fact.
- **New entity type**: create the `Assets/Data/<Type>/` folder, register the prefix, add a
  one-row dispatch, create the `_order.json` manifest, author via `_additions/`.

### Validation tooling

- `Tools/XmlValidator.exe -a` — schema and data-load check (run from `Assets/`).
- `Tools/verify-python24.py` — the embedded interpreter is Python 2.4; this catches newer syntax.
- `Tools/verify-spine-fields.py` — event field types match declarations.
- Save-migration checker for the format change (see "Under the hood").
- `readjson.exe Assets/Data --render BUILDING_X` — parse and English-render a single entity.

### Known future work [spec — verify]

- **Volumetric resources**: bonus counts moving from presence-only (0/1) to quantities (0..N)
  is specced as future work; not yet implemented.
- **Events rework**: engine events gaining spine emits (Python callbacks still live) — partial;
  full move to the trigger system is future work.

---

## Under the hood

The engine's derived-state layer was rebuilt completely. One event spine announces every state
change; caches are maintained running sums updated by those events instead of being recomputed
in passes; loading a save and starting a new game build state through the same event-driven
path, so there is one code path to be correct instead of two. Reads are O(1) against the
accumulated value — no re-walk of sources — and invalidation is targeted: an event touches only
the consumers it affects. There is one canonical answer per number: the legacy ad-hoc
accumulators are gone, not shadowed. The save format changed as part of this; old saves migrate
automatically via a named-tag mechanism.
